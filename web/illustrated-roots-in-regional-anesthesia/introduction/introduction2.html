Since I first uploaded the <I>Notes</I>a year ago I have discovered that many things I learned in my residency were incorrect, and I am sure that much of what I taught residents will eventually be proven wrong as well.   The rapid pace of developments in medicine make the Web an indispensable tool to find the science behind both old and new practices.  There is no day in the operating room when I don't consult the Web from the anesthesia lounge and  bring up <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/">PubMed</A> to search for the answers to a number of burning clinical questions.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="0">These <I>Notes</I> serve as a personal statement on my enthusiasm for both regional anesthesia and the Internet.  My goal is to stimulate interest and discussion of topics in regional anesthesia, and although I have attempted to be as accurate as possible in what I write, I encourage everyone to seek out the original sources.  I have found that even after a few months these articles become outdated.  With so many excellent resources for teaching regional anesthesia now available off the Web, perhaps the main value in a site such as this is the medium (<I>"the medium is the message"</I>).<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="0">As Web sites live and die and old technology gives way to new, the Web itself will endure and continue to reshape civilization.  My hope is that sites such as this, made by individuals for the purpose of freely sharing information and experience, will continue to connect people  -  <I>"mind to mind" </I> -  and dominate the New Media.</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD WIDTH="336"><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="168"><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="5"><IMG SRC="signature.gif" VSPACE="20" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="72"> <BR>Andrew M.
