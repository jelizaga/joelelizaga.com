Teaching in regional anesthesia relies heavily on descriptions of anatomy, illustrations, and observation of techniques. I think it is an area well-suited to multimedia. This site was developed as an attempt to create a richly-illustrated, fully-referenced, digital "syllabus" that would serve as a framework for discussion and provide a reading list for anesthesiology residents during their regional anesthesia rotation at the University of Washington Affilitated Hospitals. Since each anesthesia library in our system is <I>wired</I> with fast Internet connections and Web browsers, placing the <I>Notes</I> on the Web has the advantage of making them readily available to all residents. With the Web-based format, additions and revisions are easily made, and the content stays fresh.</TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="Yellow"><EM>This is no<BR>peer-<BR>reviewed<BR>journal!</EM></FONT></TD><TD WIDTH="336"><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="168"><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="5">The current <I>Notes</I> illustrates the anatomy relevant to regional blockade, describes and compares different techniques, reviews issues in the pharmacology of local anesthetics, and discusses the management of complications related to regional anesthesia. I made an attempt to review issues that aren't well-covered in the traditional anesthesia textbooks. I hope to include information on more exotic regional techniques as this site grows. Eventually, it may serve as a large archive for illustrations, photographs, digital movies, and case presentations related to regional anesthesia.</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD WIDTH="336"><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="168"><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="5">This is obviously no peer-reviewed journal. I encourage the residents who browse through this site to look up the references themselves -- go dust off that tired copy of Bromage's <I>Epidural Analgesia</I> (if you are lucky enough to find it). I invite those of you who share my enthusiasm and are much more experienced and knowledgable about regional anesthesia than I am to send your comments and criticisms. For the rest of you who are just browsing and managed to find your way here, I hope I can give you a small taste of what the practice of anesthesiology at the University of Washington is like.<BR><IMG SRC="signature.gif" VSPACE="20" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="72"> <BR>Andrew M.
