Comparison of extradural ropivacaine and bupivacaine.  <i>Br-J-Anaesth.</i>  1991 Jan.  66(1).  P 31-7.</code><p><code>Ropivacaine, a new long acting amide type local anaesthetic,               was compared with bupivacaine in a randomized double-blind               study. One hundred and ten patients undergoing extradural               anaesthesia received a test dose of 3 ml of 1% lignocaine with               adrenaline which was followed by 15 ml of one of five               solutions: 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0% ropivacaine or 0.5 or 0.75%               bupivacaine. There was little difference between the groups               with respect to speed of onset or sensory block. The duration               of analgesia was increased by increasing the concentration of               both drugs, but this had minimal effect on onset time or extent               of block. When the same concentration of each drug was               administered, there were inconsistent differences in duration  of sensory block, none of which was statistically significant.               Increasing concentration of both drugs resulted in greater               degree and longer duration of motor block. Ropivacaine produced               a slower onset, shorter duration and less intense motor block               than the same concentration of bupivacaine. The cardiovascular               changes were similar in all groups.</code></body></html>
