One hundred sciatic nerve blocks: a comparison of localisation techniques.  <I>Anaesth Intensive Care</I> 1993 Feb;21(1):76-78.  </CODE><P><CODE>One hundred sciatic nerve blocks performed for surgery related to lower limbvascular disease were prospectively audited with respect to the techniques usedfor sciatic nerve localisation and the success rates achieved. Utilising a 22gauge Quincke point needle, sciatic nerve localisation was performed byinitially searching for paraesthesia, followed by the use of a low poweredperipheral nerve stimulator. Overall there were 89 successful blocks.Paraesthesia was found in only 44 cases of which 41 were subsequently judged tobe successful blocks. A positive response to the nerve stimulator was achievedin 95 cases of which 87 went on to have successful blocks. Our findings suggestthat either eliciting paraesthesia or a positive response to the peripheralnerve stimulator carries a high correlation with subsequent successful block,but that the use of the nerve stimulator provides a more consistent andreliable technique for nerve localisation.</CODE>
