Cardiac electrophysiologic properties of bupivacaineand lidocaine compared with those of ropivacaine, a new amide local anesthetic.<I> Anesthesiology.</I> 1990 Feb. 72(2). P 322-9.</CODE><P><CODE> Ropivacaine is a new amino-amide local anesthetic whose anestheticprofile appears similar to that of bupivacaine. Moreover, in intact animalsropivacaine was reportedly less arrhythmogenic than bupivacaine. Theseexperiments evaluated the cardiac transmembrane electrophysiologic effectsof ropivacaine compared with those of lidocaine and bupivacaine in an isolatedrabbit Purkinje fiberventricular muscle preparation. Only bupivacaine (3-5micrograms/ml, 0.92- 1.5 x 10(-5) m) significantly decreased Purkinje fibermaximum diastolic potential. Action potential amplitude and maximal rateof depolarization (Vmax) were significantly decreased by all agents in thefollowing order: bupivacaine, ropivacaine, lidocaine. High concentrationsof bupivacaine and ropivacaine caused premature depolarizations during phase3 in some preparations. In addition, bupivacaine altered the action potentialconfiguration by producing "notching" not seen with either ropivacaine orlidocaine. This may reflect effects caused by changes in Ca2+, K+, orelectrotonic effects. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine (30 micrograms/ml, 9.2x 10(-5) m) and lidocaine (100 micrograms/ml, 3.74 x 10(-4) m) caused Purkinjefiber inexcitability and Purkinje fiber- ventricular muscle conduction block.However, the duration of PF inexcitability following exposure to ropivacaineand lidocaine was significantly shorter than in bupivacaine-treated preparation.Duration of PF-VM conduction block also tended to be shorter for ropivacainethan bupivacaine, but significantly longer than lidocaine. In general,ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine but more potent than lidocainein terms of its depressant effect on cardiac excitation and conduction. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
