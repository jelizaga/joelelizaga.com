A double-blindcomparison of the abdominal wall relaxation produced by epidural 0.75%ropivacaine and 0.75% bupivacaine in gynecologic surgery. <I>Reg-Anesth.</I>1995 Nov-Dec. 20(6). P 515- 20.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ropivacaine is a long-acting local anestheticagent with similar potency to that of bupivacaine when administered for epiduralanesthesia. Ropivacaine, however, may be less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.Epidural bupivacaine and ropivacaine have been shown to be equally effectivein providing sensory block for lower extremity surgery, but they have notbeen compared for their ability to produce abdominal wall relaxation. </CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: Sixty-six American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III women,18-70 years old undergoing elective gynecologic surgery were studied in arandomized, double-blind manner after giving informed consent in aninstitutionally approved protocol. Thirty-four patients received a singleepidural injection of 20 ml 0.75% bupivacaine at the L2-L3-L4 interspaceand 32 patients received 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine in a similar manner. Sensoryblock was tested with pinprick; motor block with a modified Bromage scale,rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) test and surgeon satisfaction. Statisticalanalysis was performed using the SigmaStat for Windows computer software.Parametric data were analyzed with Student's t-test, while nonparametricdata was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS: Results are expressed as mean +/- SD. Times to maximal sensoryblock and peak sensory level achieved were similar in both groups. However,time to complete sensory regression was significantly longer with bupivacainethan ropivacaine (458 +/- 77 vs. 404 +/- 62 minutes, P &lt;.03). Bupivacainelower extremity motor block onset was significantly faster than ropivacaine(9 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 3 minutes, P &lt;.0013). Time to maximum lower extremitymotor block was significantly shorter with bupivacaine than ropivacaine (28+/- 12 vs. 40 +/- 15 minutes, P &lt;.0234). Duration of lower extremity motorblock was significantly longer with bupivacaine than ropivacaine (371 +/-97 vs. 310 +/- 65 minutes P &lt; .069). There was no significant differencebetween the two groups for changes in RAM scores or the time to achieve thosechanges. Maximum motor block scores using the modified Bromage score andsurgeon satisfaction with operating conditions also did not demonstrate asignificant difference between the two groups. In one instance (withropivacaine), anesthesia was judged clinically inadequate despite evidenceof bilateral epidural anesthesia. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: Both 0.75% ropivacaine and 0.75% bupivacaine provide adequatesurgical anesthesia for lower abdominal surgery when administered epidurally.However, lower extremity motor block with ropivacaine is significantly shorterand of slower onset and sensory block shorter at these concentrations. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
