A comparison of single versus double injection technique.  <I>Reg Anesth</I> 1994 Jan;19(1):9-13.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Two techniques, single versus double injection, forblocking the sciatic nerve via the classical (Labat) approach wereprospectively evaluated for onset and efficacy of block in 50 adult patientsundergoing lower extremity surgery. The tibial, common peroneal, and posteriorfemoral cutaneous nerves were evaluated at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutesafter the initial injection of local anesthetic. Motor function was used toassess the block of the tibial and common peroneal nerves while pinprickresponse was used to assess block of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. Group 1 (n = 25) received a single injection of 20 mL of anamide-ester solution (1% lidocaine/0.2% tetracaine) with epinephrine 1:200,000when either component of the sciatic nerve (tibial or peroneal) was identifiedwith the aid of a peripheral nerve stimulator. Group 2 (n = 25) received two 10mL injections of the same solution with the tibial and peroneal components ofthe sciatic nerve being identified and injected separately (through the sameskin wheal in serial fashion by withdrawing and redirecting the needle). Thetwo groups were compared at each of the time intervals with analysis ofvariance. </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS. Group 2 (double injection) showed faster onset and betterefficacy (P < .05) at all time intervals evaluated. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: The doubleinjection technique for sciatic nerve block via the classical approach resultsin a more rapid onset and increased efficacy of block than that of the singleinjection technique.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
