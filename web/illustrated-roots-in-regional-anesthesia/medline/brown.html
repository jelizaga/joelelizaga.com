Comparison of 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine for               epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing lower-extremity               surgery. <i>Anesthesiology.</i>  1990 Apr.  72(4).  P 633-6.</code><p><code>Ropivacaine is an amide local anesthetic structurally related               to, but appearing less cardiotoxic, than bupivacaine. The               authors' investigation was designed in a randomized, double-               blind fashion to compare the clinical effectiveness of               ropivacaine and bupivacaine in patients undergoing lower-               extremity surgery. Forty-five patients were randomized to               receive 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine or bupivacaine. Intermittent               sensory (pinprick) and motor (Bromage score) measurements were               made while the block was in effect, and changes in heart rate,               blood pressure and amounts of additional analgesics, sedatives               and other medications were also recorded. Presence of tourniquet pain and the quality of anesthesia were also               assessed. One patient was excluded from analysis; thus, 22               patients each received ropivacaine or bupivacaine. No               differences were found in patient or perioperative               characteristics between the groups. The quality and extent of               sensory and motor blockade between groups were comparable,               although bupivacaine was slightly longer acting. Cardiovascular               changes, incidence of tourniquet pain, and the amounts of               supplemental medications necessary were also similar between               groups. The authors found 0.5% ropivacaine and bupivacaine to               be clinically similar in both sensory- and motor-blocking               characteristics, with the exception that bupivacaine produced a               blockade of slightly longer duration. Because ropivacaine is               reported to be less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine in animal               studies, the similarity of clinical epidural anesthesia may               make ropivacaine the preferred agent.</code></body></html>
