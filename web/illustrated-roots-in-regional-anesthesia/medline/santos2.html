Pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine in nonpregnant and pregnant ewes.<I>Anesth-Analg.</I>  1990 Mar.  70(3).  P 262-6.</CODE><P><CODE>The pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine were studied in               chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. On the               day of study, the urinary bladder was catheterized.               Ropivacaine (2.5 or 3.0 mg/kg) was administered by               intravenous infusion over 2 or 4 min. Serial samples of               arterial blood and urine were collected over 5 h, and drug               concentrations were determined using a gas chromatographic               technique. Total clearance of ropivacaine was lower in               the pregnant animals (21.6 +/- 4.5 mL.min-1.kg-1) compared with               the nonpregnant animals (45.1 +/- 6.7 mL.min-1.kg-1). There was               a tendency toward a decrease in the volume of distribution               during the terminal exponential phase of drug elimination of               2.03 +/- 0.36 L/kg in the pregnant and 4.32 +/- 1.03 L/kg in               the nonpregnant sheep. Thus the difference in the elimination               half-life was only minimal: 74.7 +/- 10.7 min in the pregnant               and 64.4 +/- 7.4 min in the nonpregnant animals. It is               concluded that ovine pregnancy is accompanied by changes in the               pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine. Inadvertent intravenous               injections of similar drug doses to pregnant and nonpregnant               women might result in higher plasma concentrations of               ropivacaine in the former. However, the rate of decline               in plasma levels of the drug would be similar in both.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
