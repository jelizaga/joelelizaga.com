Selective musculocutaneous nerve block and infraclavicularbrachial plexus anesthesia. Case report.  <I>Reg Anesth</I> 1995 May;20(3):239-241</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Regional anesthesia of the upper extremity may be achieved by theinfraclavicular approach to the brachial plexus. </CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. Advantages of this approach includeprofound anesthesia of the upper extremity with minimal risk of complications. </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS. Isolated blockof the musculocutaneous nerve may result by this approach if biceps muscle contractions are accepted asevidence of brachial plexus location by peripheral nerve stimulation. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS. Stimulation of themusculocutaneous nerve in the infraclavicular region results in biceps muscle contraction. Inadequateanesthesia of the upper extremity may result due to exiting of the musculocutaneous nerve outside theaxillary sheath in this region. Evidence of more distal stimulation (finger/wrist flexion) improves thelikelihood of successful block of the brachial plexus by the infraclavicular route. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
