P 276-83.</code><P><code>This paper reports the cardiovascular effects of intentionally               toxic intravenous doses of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and               ropivacaine and the mechanisms of death. Fatal doses of               lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine were established in               sheep treated with successive daily dose increments of each               drug. The mean fatal dose of lidocaine (+/- SD) was 1450 +/-               191 mg (30.8 +/- 5.8 mg/kg), that of bupivacaine was 156 +/- 31               mg (3.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg), and that of ropivacaine was 325 +/- 108 mg (7.3 +/- 1.0 mg/kg); thus the ratio of fatal doses was               approximately 9:1:2. In four out of four lidocaine-treated               animals, respiratory depression with bradycardia and               hypotension without arrhythmias were the causes of death. Three               out of four bupivacaine-treated animals died after the sudden               onset of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation without hypoxia               or acidosis; the fourth died in a similar manner to the               lidocaine-treated animals. Three out of five animals given               ropivacaine died in a manner resembling the fatal effects of               lidocaine-treated animals, but unlike the lidocaine-treated               animals, in all three sheep there were also periods of               ventricular arrhythmias. The remaining two ropivacaine-treated               sheep died as a result of the sudden onset of ventricular               tachycardia/fibrillation. The mean percentages of the fatal               dose found in the myocardium was 2.8 +/- 0.7 for lidocaine-               treated animals, 3.3 +/- 0.9 for bupivacaine-treated animals,               and 2.2 +/- 1.4 for ropivacaine-treated animals; the corresponding percentages in whole brain were, respectively,               0.71 +/- 0.01, 0.71 +/- 0.21, and 0.89 +/- 0.27.</code></body></html>
