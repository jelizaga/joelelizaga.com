Reevaluation of the sciatic nerve block.  <I>Reg Anesth</I> 1993 Jan;18(1):18-23.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Sciatic nerve blocks are perceived as unreliable,technically demanding, and uncomfortable. With strict criteria to definesuccess rates, we designed a study to examine the efficacy of two techniques ofsciatic nerve block.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. All blocks were performed by a novice in sedatedpatients using an insulated needle and a nerve stimulator.</CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS. Overallsuccess with both techniques was 87.5%. One transient neurologic deficitattributed to the sciatic nerve block was observed; otherwise, the techniqueprovided satisfactory anesthesia without complications.</CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS. Patient acceptance was excellent.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
