Spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine:a double-blind study on the efficacy and safety of 0.5% and 0.75% solutionsin patients undergoing minor lower limb surgery. <I>Anesth-Analg.</I> 1994Jun. 78(6). P 1125-30.</CODE><P><CODE>The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy andsafety of ropivacaine as a local anesthetic for spinal anesthesia. Fortypatients between the ages of 18 and 75 yr, scheduled for minor lower limbsurgery, were studied. They were randomly allocated to receive either 3 mLglucose-free 0.5% (15 mg) or 0.75% (22.5 mg) ropivacaine in a double-blindfashion. The subarachnoid puncture was performed with a 26-gauge Quincke-pointneedle at the L3-4 interspace with the patients in the sitting position.The onset of analgesia to pinprick was similar with both concentrations.The median (range) upper level of analgesia obtained with the 0.5% solutionwas T11 (L4-T5) and was T10-11 (L4-T4) with the 0.75% solution. The durationof analgesia at T12 (P &lt; 0.01) and the total duration of analgesia (P&lt; 0.002) were longer in the 0.75% group. In addition, the area under thenumber of blocked segments versus time curve was larger with the 0.75%ropivacaine solution (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of complete motor blockof the lower limbs was higher (P &lt; 0.02) and the total duration of motorblock longer (P &lt; 0.002) in the 0.75% group. No unexpected adverse eventswere registered. We conclude that subarachnoid injection of glucose-freeropivacaine solutions results in a variable spread of analgesia, mostlyaccompanied by a good quality of motor block, in particular with the 0.75%solution.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
