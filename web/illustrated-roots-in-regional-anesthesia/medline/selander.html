To test this hypothesis, weprospectively followed two groups of patients who underwent hand surgery withan axillary block. In one group, the axillary plexus was located by activelyseeking paresthesiae; in the other, pulsations of the axillary artery indicatedan adequate position of the injection needle. Mepivacaine 10 mg/ml, with orwithout adrenaline, was used. The study included 533 patients, 290 in theparesthesia group and 243 in the artery group. Although unintentional,paresthesiae were elicited in 40% of patients in the artery group.Postanesthetic nerve lesions were seen in ten patients, eight in theparesthesia group and two in the artery group, all of whom had been blocked bymepivacaine with adrenaline. Symptoms varied between light paresthesiae lastinga few weeks, and severe paresthesiae, ache and paresis lasting more than 1year. The etiology suspected was needle and perhaps injection trauma to thenerves during blocking. We conclude that whenever possible nerve blocks shouldbe performed without searching for paresthesiae.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
