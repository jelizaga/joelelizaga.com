Comparison of lumbar plexus block versus conventional opioid analgesia after  total knee replacement.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1991;  46(4):  275-7.<P>A randomised controlled study was undertaken to assess the analgesic efficacy of continuous lumbar plexus block for the first 48 hours after total knee replacement surgery. Boluses of 0.5% bupivacaine with adrenaline 1 in 200,000  (0.3 ml/kg) were administered through a cannula inserted into the neurovascular  sheath of the femoral nerve. Thirteen patients who received this block required  significantly less morphine than a control group of 16 patients.  Pain scores  were similar and there were no complications related to this technique.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
