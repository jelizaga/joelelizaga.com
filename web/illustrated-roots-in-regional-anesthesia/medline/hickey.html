Winnie-A-P.A comparative study of 0.25% ropivacaine and 0.25%               bupivacaine for brachial plexus block.<i>Anesth-Analg.</i>  1992 Oct.  75(4).  P 602-6.</code><p><code> The present study compares the effectiveness of 0.25%               ropivacaine and 0.25% bupivacaine in 44 patients receiving a               subclavian perivascular brachial plexus block for upper               extremity surgery. The patients were assigned to two equal               groups in this randomized, double-blind study; one group               received ropivacaine 0.25% (112.5 mg) and the other,               bupivacaine 0.25% (112.5 mg), both without epinephrine. Onset               times for analgesia and anesthesia in each of the C-5 through               T-1 brachial plexus dermatomes did not differ significantly               between the two groups. The mean onset time for analgesia               ranged from 11.2 to 20.2 min, and the mean onset time for  anesthesia ranged from 23.3 to 48.2 min. The onset of motor               block differed only with respect to paresis in the hand, with               bupivacaine demonstrating a shorter onset time than               ropivacaine. The duration of sensory and motor block also was               not significantly different between the two groups. The mean               duration of analgesia ranged from 9.2 to 13.0 h, and the mean               duration of anesthesia ranged from 5.0 to 10.2 h. Both groups               required supplementation with peripheral nerve blocks or               general anesthesia in a large number of cases, with 9 of the 22               patients in the bupivacaine group and 8 of the 22 patients in               the ropivacaine group requiring supplementation to allow               surgery to begin. In view of the frequent need for               supplementation noted with both 0.25% ropivacaine and 0.25%               bupivacaine, we do not recommend using the 0.25% concentrations               of these local anesthetics to provide brachial plexus block.</code></body></html>
