A clinical and pharmacokineticcomparison of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in axillary plexus block.<I>Anesth-Analg.</I> 1995 Sep. 81(3). P 534-8. </CODE><P><CODE>The clinical and pharmacokinetic properties of ropivacaine and bupivacaine,both 5 mg/mL, used in axillary plexus block were compared in 60 patientsin this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The axillary plexuswas identified with a nerve stimulator and 30, 35, or 40 mL of drug, dependingon body weight, was injected into the perivascular sheath. In 20 patients,venous blood samples for the pharmacokinetic measurement were obtained over24 h. The median onset times for anesthesia and complete motor block werein the range of 12-48 min and 5-20 min, respectively. Thirty- eight percentof patients in the ropivacaine group and 29% in the bupivacaine group neededadditional nerve block(s) or supplementary analgesia and 7% in the bupivacainegroup needed general anesthesia for surgery. Anesthesia was achieved in 52%-86%of the evaluated six nerves in the ropivacaine group and in 36%-87% in thebupivacaine group; the lowest figures were seen in the musculocutaneous nerve.In the pharmacokinetic study the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were1.28 +/- 0.21 mg/L in the ropivacaine group and 1.28 +/- 0.47 mg/L in thebupivacaine group and the median times to peak plasma concentration (tmax)were 0.86 h and 0.96 h, respectively. The median terminal half-lives (t1/2)were 7.1 h and 11.5 h in the ropivacaine group and the bupivacaine group,respectively (P = 0.07). No statistically significant differences were foundbetween ropivacaine and bupivacaine in either the clinical or the pharmacokineticcomparisons. </CODE><P></BODY></HTML>
