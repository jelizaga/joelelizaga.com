Dural puncture with a 26-gauge spinal needle affects  spread of epidural anesthesia.<I> Anesth-Analg.</I>  1996 May.  82(5).  P 1040-2.</CODE><P><CODE>Combined spinal and epidural anesthesia may increase the risk  of epidurally administered drugs spreading into the  subarachnoid space through the dural hole. We studied the  effect of dural puncture with a 26-gauge needle on the spread  of analgesia induced by epidural injection of local  anesthetics. Forty patients were randomly assigned to control  and dural puncture groups. In the dural puncture group, the  dura was punctured with a 26-gauge Whitacre spinal needle at  L2-3 but no drug was injected. In both groups, an 18-gauge  epidural catheter was inserted 4 cm cephalad into the epidural  space at L2-3 and 15 mL of 2% mepivacaine without epinephrine  was injected. Analgesia was assessed by pinprick at 5, 10, 15,  and 20 min after injection and at the end of surgery. The  caudal spread of analgesia was significantly greater in the  dural puncture group than in the control group 15 and 20 min  after injection (P < 0.01), but the cranial spread of analgesia  was not different between the two groups. We conclude that  dural puncture (without drugs) using a 26-gauge Whitacre spinal  needle before epidural injection increases caudal spread of  analgesia induced by epidural local anesthetics.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
