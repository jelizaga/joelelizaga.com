A comparison of three regional anaesthesia techniques for outpatient knee  arthroscopy.  Can J Anaesth 1997; 44(4): 371- 6.<P>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare intraoperative conditions and  postoperative pain control of three peripheral regional anaesthesia techniques for outpatient knee arthroscopic procedures.<P>METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized to one of three groups. Group 1A received portal injections (10 ml  lidocaine 1%), intraarticular lidocaine (20 ml CO2 lidocaine 2% with 1/200,000  adrenaline) and a placebo femoral nerve block (20 ml saline). Group FNB  received a femoral 3-in-1 nerve block (20 ml chloroprocaine 2% with 1/200,000  adrenaline), placebo portal injections (10 ml saline) and placebo  intraarticular saline (20 ml saline with 1/200,000 adrenaline). Group FNB + IA  received a femoral 3-in-1 nerve block, intraarticular lidocaine and placebo  portal injections. The following were assessed: intraoperative pain (10 cm VAS:  0 = no pain, 10 = extreme pain), surgical operating conditions (1 = excellent,  4 = unacceptable), intraoperative use of sedation and analgesia, time to  discharge, patient satisfaction score (1 = very satisfied, 5 very unsatisfied)  and postoperative analgesia. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis,  and Chi-square tests as appropriate, P < 0.05 was considered significant.<P>RESULTS: There were no differences among the groups regarding any of the  variables tested. Considerable post-operative pain (VAS > or = 5) was  experienced by 20/54 (37%) patients.<P>CONCLUSION: Any of the three anaesthetic techniques tested provide reliable intraoperative patient and surgical conditions for outpatient knee arthroscopy. Patient discomfort postoperatively was considerable in all groups and requires further investigation.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
