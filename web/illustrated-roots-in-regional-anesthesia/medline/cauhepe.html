[Article in French]  <I>Ann Fr Anesth Reanim</I> 1989;  8(4):  376- 8.<P>The technique described by Winnie in 1973 is supposed to provide a regional  block of the femoral, femoral cutaneous, and obturator nerves by a single  injection within the femoral nerve sheath. This study aimed to assess the diffusion spaces for the local anaesthetic solution used in this technique. The  anatomical study included the dissection of 2 adult and 1 foetal cadavers. It  was associated with a radiographic study in adult volunteers.  About 20 to 60 ml  of an isotonic radiographic contrast (iopamidol 150) were injected into the  femoral nerve sheath located with the help of a nerve stimulator. Standard  pelvic radiographs and computerised tomographic scans were carried out at the  time of injection, and 30 min later. Two different unpredictable distributions  were found; which were independent of the injected volume. One type consisted  in an internal diffusion towards the psoas major muscle, the liquid thus  reaching the three nerves.  The other type was an external diffusion, in front  of the iliacus muscle, the liquid never reaching the internal side of the psoas  major muscle, and therefore the obturator nerve. The "3 in 1" block would  therefore seem to be useful for those surgical acts requiring only a block of  the femoral and femoral cutaneous nerves, i.e. those involving the anterior  aspect of the thigh and knee, the femoral shaft, and the patella. On the other  hand, its usefulness for surgery of the hip (dislocation, fractured neck of femur) is rather uncertain.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
