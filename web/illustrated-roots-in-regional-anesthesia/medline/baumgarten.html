Importance of the needle bevel during spinal and  epidural anesthesia. <I>Reg-Anesth.</I>  1995 May-Jun.  20(3).  P 234-8.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. The needle bevel has an important  effect on the path that the needle takes as it traverses  tissue. Many anesthesiologists, especially trainees, are  unaware of the magnitude of this effect. There is a need for a  model, constructed from readily available materials, that can  be used to demonstrate the bevel effect and to assess various  strategies for accurately advancing the needle.<CODE><P><CODE>METHODS.  Styrofoam blocks were prepared. The following needles were  studied: 25-gauge Quincke, 22-gauge Quincke, 18-gauge Quincke,  24-gauge Sprotte, 25-gauge Whitacre, 22-gauge Tuohy, and 17-  gauge Tuohy. The effect of bevel orientation on deflection from  midline was measured. Representative results were photographed.</CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS. The bevel has a significant effect on the path of  Quincke and Tuohy needles. The deflection is more pronounced  for thinner needles. Pencil-point needles show much less  deflection than Quincke needles.</CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS. Styrofoam blocks  provide a model for teaching the basics of spinal and epidural  anesthesia. By utilizing styrofoam the trainee can master  needle control and gauge the effect of bevel orientation.</CODE></BODY><HTML>
