P 284-8.</code><P><code>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. This study reports subjective  experiences of nine anesthesiologists undergoing three  consecutive epidural anesthetics.</code><P><code>METHODS. Eight  anesthesiologists and one nurse anesthetist, all ASA physical  status 1, underwent three lumbar epidural anesthetics as part  of another study. Epidural catheters were inserted via a 17-  gauge Tuohy needle without sedation after local anesthesia with  pH adjusted lidocaine at the second, third, or fourth lumbar  interspace. Three local anesthetics (2% lidocaine HCl, 3%  chloroprocaine HCl, and 0.75% bupivacaine HCl) were  administered each separated by at least 48 hours. The local  anesthetic was incrementally injected via the epidural catheter  to achieve at least a T-1 dermatome level of analgesia. Each  subject completed a written questionnaire at the end of the  study regarding their experience.</code><P><code>RESULTS. Most of the subjects  (7 of 9) had no prior epidural anesthesia. Eight of nine  subjects experienced at least one paresthesia during catheter  insertion; this was uniformly described as a "poorly localized  burning sensation," radiating to the hip or leg. All subjects  reported difficulty taking a deep breath and coughing with a T-  1 level of analgesia. Eight of nine subjects reported dysphoria  during lidocaine epidural anesthesia. Eight of nine subjects  reported moderate back pain after dissipation of chloroprocaine  epidural anesthesia. </code.<P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS. All volunteers stated that  they would change their anesthetic practice as a result of  participation in this study. They believed that having  experienced an epidural anesthetic made them better qualified  to prepare patients for this anesthetic technique.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
