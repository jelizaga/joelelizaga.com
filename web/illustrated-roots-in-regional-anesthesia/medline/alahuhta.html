The effects of epidural ropivacaine and bupivacainefor cesarean section on uteroplacental and fetal circulation.<I>Anesthesiology. </I> 1995 Jul. 83(1). P 23-32.</CODE><P><CODE> BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine is a new long-acting amide local anestheticthat has been shown in animal studies to have less dysrhythmogenic andcardiotoxic potential than bupivacaine. The intravenous administration ofropivacaine has not been associated with any detrimental effects on uterineblood flow in pregnant ewes. The purpose of this randomized, double-blindstudy was to examine the effects of epidural ropivacaine for cesarean sectionon blood flow velocity waveforms in uteroplacental and fetal arteries withcolor Doppler ultrasound and to assess whether the block modified fetalmyocardial function. </CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: Healthy parturient women with singleton, uncomplicated pregnanciesat term received 115-140 mg 0.5% ropivacaine (n = 11) or 0.5% bupivacaine(n = 10) in incremental epidural doses. The first ultrasound measurementwas performed before injection of the study drug. Pulsatility indexes (PI)were derived for the blood flow velocity waveforms of the maternal placentaland nonplacental uterine arteries; the placental arcuate artery; and thefetal umbilical, middle cerebral, and renal arteries. The fetal heart thenwas examined by echocardiography. The PI of the maternal uterine arteriesand the fetal umbilical artery were measured 5 min after the injection ofthe local anesthetic. When sensory analgesia had reached the T6-T4 level,the ultrasound measurement was repeated with the same methods and targetsas in the baseline measurement. </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS: Both drugs provided adequate surgical anesthesia for cesareansection. In the bupivacaine group, the PI values for the maternal placentaland nonplacental uterine arteries increased significantly 5 min after themain dose (P = 0.01, P = 0.002) and when sensory analgesia had reached theT6- T4 level (P = 0.004, P = 0.01) as compared with the baseline measurement.Simultaneously, the PI in the fetal middle cerebral artery decreasedsignificantly (P = 0.02). The PI for the maternal uterine artery increasedsignificantly (P = 0.01) after ropivacaine administration but only on thenonplacental side and not until sensory analgesia had reached the T6-T4 level.No effect on the Doppler indexes obtained from the umbilical artery was observedin either group. There were no significant differences relative to baselinevalues in any fetal myocardial measurement or in any ultrasound measurementbetween the groups. Neither drug had any detrimental effect on Apgar scoresor umbilical cord acid-base status. None of the neonates' conditions wasmarkedly depressed according to neurobehavioral testing. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: Within this small study, epidural 0.5% ropivacaine forcesarean section did not compromise the utero-placental circulation in healthyparturient women with uncomplicated pregnancies. It provided surgical anesthesiathat was equally effective as that provided by 0.5% bupivacaine. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
