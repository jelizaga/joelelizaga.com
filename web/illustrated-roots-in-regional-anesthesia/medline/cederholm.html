Sensory, motor, and sympatheticblock during epidural analgesia with 0.5% and 0.75% ropivacaine with andwithout epinephrine. <I>Reg-Anesth.</I> 1994 Jan-Feb. 19(1). P 18-33.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Ropivacaine is a new long- acting localanesthetic, with vasoconstrictive properties. The purpose of this randomized,double-blind study was to evaluate sensory, motor, and sympathetic blockfollowing epidural anesthesia, and the influence of the addition of epinephrine.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. Forty-eight male patients, scheduled for transurethral surgery,received 20 mL of 0.5% or 0.75% ropivacaine with or without addition ofepinephrine (5 micrograms/mL) epidurally. Sensory block was assessed by pinprick,motor block by a modified Bromage scale, and sympathetic block by skin resistancelevel, skin resistance response, skin temperature, and skin blood flow (laserDoppler flowmetry). RESULTS. Onset time for analgesia was short (Th10 blockedafter median 5.3-6.7 minutes), and maximum segmental level was median Th2-3 (range, Th5-C4). A tendency toward a dose-response relationship (durationof sensory block) was noted for the 0.75% solutions (median, 258-264 minutesat Th10) compared to the 0.5% solutions (median, 228-234 minutes at Th10).Only about half of the patients exhibited a complete motor block of the lowerextremities with a longer duration with the 0.75% solutions. The majorityof patients had a marked or complete sympathetic block in the lower limbs.Short-lasting, mild hypotension, responding well to ephedrine intravenously,was noted in 40%- 70% of the patients. No serious adverse reactions wereobserved. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS. Ropivacaine given epidurally provided adequate sensoryanesthesia and motor block for transurethral surgery. Addition of epinephrinedid not provide any significant prolongation of the sensory or motor block,nor any influence upon the sympathetic block. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
