Clinical effects and maternaland fetal plasma concentrations of epidural ropivacaine versus bupivacainefor cesarean section. <I>Anesthesiology.</I> 1995 Jun. 82(6). P 1346-52.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine is a new amide local anesthetic structurallysimilar to bupivacaine and mepivacaine. Previous studies showed that ropivacainehas a similar clinical effect as bupivacaine with regard to sensory anesthesiaand slightly less motor blockade than bupivacaine. Ropivacaine appears tobe less cardiotoxic and arrhythmogenic than bupivacaine. The clinical andpharmacokinetic effects of 0.5% ropivacaine (5 mg/ml) versus 0.5% bupivacaine(5 mg/ml) when used epidurally for elective cesarean section were investigated.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind study design, 60 ASA physicalstatus 1 or 2 term parturients presenting for elective cesarean section receivedeither 0.5% bupivacaine (150 mg) or 0.5% ropivacaine (150 mg) epidurallyin appropriate fractionated doses over a 10-min period. Onset, duration,and regression of sensory and motor blockade were noted until complete resolutionwas observed. Quality of intraoperative anesthesia and abdominal wall musclerelaxation were noted. Maternal plasma concentrations of local anestheticwere determined before anesthetic administration and 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60min and 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after drug injection in 20 subjects. Umbilicalcord blood was obtained at time of delivery for acid-base values anddetermination of the free and total plasma concentration of local anesthetic.Neonates also were examined for neurobehavioral assessments by Scanlon'sand Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores at 2 and 24 h after delivery.</CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS: All patients received satisfactory anesthesia for operation.The onset, duration, and regression of sensory blockade were similar forboth groups. Onset of degree 1 and 2 motor blockade was faster, and durationof degree 1 motor block was longer in the group receiving bupivacaine.Hemodynamic sequelae were similar between groups. All neonates had 5-minApgar scores of 7 or greater and normal acid-base values and neurobehavioralassessments. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the Cmax was similar forboth drugs (1.3 +/- 0.09 for ropivacaine and 1.1 +/- 0.09 micrograms/ml forbupivacaine). The T1/2 of the terminal decline in plasma concentration wasshorter for ropivacaine versus bupivacaine (5.2 +/- 0.60 versus 10.9 +/-1.08 h, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). The free (i.e., unbound) concentrationsof ropivacaine were approximately twice those of bupivacaine in both maternaland neonatal blood at the time of delivery. The ratio of umbilical vein tomaternal vein concentration of unbound drug was 0.72 for ropivacaine and0.69 for bupivacaine. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: Ropivacaine, 0.5%, epidurally provided satisfactory andsimilar sensory anesthesia compared to 0.5% bupivacaine for elective cesareansection. The Cmax was similar for both drugs, although the terminal half-lifeof ropivacaine was significantly shorter, and the blood concentrations offree ropivacaine were significantly greater than that for bupivacaine. Thesevalues were less than concentrations shown to be toxic in animals. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
