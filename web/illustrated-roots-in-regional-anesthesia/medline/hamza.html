Parturient's posture during epidural puncture affects the distance from skin to epidural space <I> J-Clin-Anesth.</I>  1995 Feb.  7(1).  P 1-4.</CODE><P><CODE>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors affecting the distance from skin to epidural space. </CODE><P><CODE>DESIGN: Prospective observational study of consecutive cases over a 2-year period.</CODE><P><CODE>SETTING: Inpatient obstetric unit in a French university hospital.</CODE><P><CODE>PATIENTS: 2,123 consecutive term parturients who received epidural anesthesia for cesarean section or epidural analgesia for labor and vaginal delivery.</CODE><P><CODE>INTERVENTIONS: At the time of epidural puncture, the interspace used and the patient's posture (sitting or left lateral decubitus) were recorded, and the distance from the skin to the epidural space (DS-ES) was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a marked epidural needle.</CODE><P><CODE>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The relationship between patient factors [height, weight, body mass index (BMI; weight/height2), presence of scoliosis] and technical factors (interspace, patient's posture at puncture) versus DS-ES was investigated using multiple regression analysis. DS-ES correlated positively with the parturient's weight and BMI. In addition, DS-ES was significantly greater when epidural puncture was performed in the lateral position as compared with the sitting position.</CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSION: Both the patient's weight and position during epidural needle placement are important factors influencing DS- ES. A change from the sitting to the lateral position may increase DS-ES, causing catheter dislodgment and consequent inadequate analgesia. Clinical studies relating DS-ES to inadequate analgesia must take these factors into account.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
