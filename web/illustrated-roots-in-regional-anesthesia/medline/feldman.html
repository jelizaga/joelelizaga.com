Covino-B-G. Comparative systemic toxicity of convulsant and supraconvulsant               doses of intravenous ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and               lidocaine in the conscious dog.<i>Anesth-Analg.</i>  1989 Dec.  69(6).  P 794-801.</code><P><code>This study evaluated the systemic toxicity, arrhythmogenicity, and mode of death of convulsant and supraconvulsant doses of               lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine. Experiments in awake               dogs were designed to mimic the clinical situation of an               accidental intravenous (IV) injection of local anesthetics. On               the first experimental day, lidocaine (8 mg.kg-1.min-1),               bupivacaine (2 mg.kg-1.min-1), and ropivacaine (2 mg.kg-1.min-               1) were infused intravenously until seizures occurred (n = 6               for each group). The average dose and arterial plasma  concentration at seizure onset was 20.8 +/- 4.0 mg/kg and 47.2               +/- 5.4 micrograms/mL for lidocaine, 4.31 +/- 0.36 mg/kg and               18.0 +/- 2.7 micrograms/mL for bupivacaine, and 4.88 +/- 0.47               mg/kg and 11.4 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mL for ropivacaine. The               margin of safety between the convulsive and lethal doses was               determined by administering two times the convulsive dose 24 h               later. Two dogs given lidocaine died because of progressive               hypotension, respiratory arrest, and finally cardiovascular               collapse with an average peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of               469 micrograms/mL. No ventricular arrhythmias were observed in               this group. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in five of six               dogs receiving bupivacaine. Four animals died because of               hypotension, respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular collapse.               One additional animal died because of ventricular fibrillation.               The Cmax for bupivacaine was 70.1 +/- 14.6 micrograms/mL in               nonsurvivors. In the ropivacaine group one animal died because               of hypotension, respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular collapse  (Cmax = 72.4 micrograms/mL).  A surviving dog had transient               premature ventricular contractions. Twenty-four hours later               three times the convulsive dose was administered to the               survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</code></body></html>
