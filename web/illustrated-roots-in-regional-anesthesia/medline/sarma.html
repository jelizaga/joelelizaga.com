A study of three cases. <I> Acta-Anaesthesiol-Scand.</I>  1990 Aug.  34(6).  P 511-3.</CODE><P><CODE>Three patients, presenting with various traumatic, vasospastic and chronic neuromuscular disorders of the upper body, received continuous axillary block ranging from 4 to 16 days. Intermittent injections of 0.25% bupivacaine were used to provide analgesia, sympathetic blockade and muscle relaxation. No systemic or neurological side-effects were recorded. Nerve function recovered promptly after stopping the injections. It is concluded that continuous brachial plexus blockade is a clinically safe and effective technique for the relief of acute traumatic pain and vasospastic disorders of the upper limb. The technique, its merits and possible complications are discussed.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
