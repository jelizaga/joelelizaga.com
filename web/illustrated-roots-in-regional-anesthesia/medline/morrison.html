P 164-9.</CODE><P><CODE>Ninety-one patients were allocated randomly to three groups to               receive 1% ropivacaine 10 ml, 0.5% ropivacaine 20               ml or 0.5% bupivacaine 20 ml extradurally. Intermittent sensory               (pinprick) and motor (Bromage scale) assessments of the block               produced were recorded, with an assessment of the quality of               the block and the requirement for supplementary analgesia.               There was little difference between the groups in frequency,               onset, duration or spread of sensory block. However, the motor               block produced by 0.5% ropivacaine was less intense and               of shorter duration than that with bupivacaine. The block               produced by the smaller volume of ropivacaine was less               reliable clinically than the larger, more dilute, solution and               more anaesthetic supplements were required in that group.               Cardiovascular changes were similar in all three groups. The               peak plasma concentration of ropivacaine was               significantly greater and T1/2 significantly shorter than those               of bupivacaine, although no patient showed any features of               systemic toxicity. The systemic kinetics of ropivacaine               were not influenced significantly by varying the concentration               or volume administered.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
