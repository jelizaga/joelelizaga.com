Experiences with a combined sciatic and femoral block in surgery of injuries of the lower leg. [Article in German].  <I>Anaesthesiol Reanim</I> 1989;  14(5):299-303.<P>Besides various methods of general anaesthesia, regional anaesthetic procedures are well suited for the surgical care of traumatological patients. For operations on patients with lesions of the lower leg, we have been using for 3 years a combination of dorsolateral blockade of the sciatic nerve according to Winnie with a "3 in 1-block". Our experiences with 80 patients show that a complete anaesthesia of the operation field holds for about 100 minutes with a blockade using 1.5% lidocaine with adrenaline. Main indications of this method are operations on lesions of the fibular ligament, leg fractures, ankle joint fractures, removal of osteosynthesis metal and other operations on the leg or foot. Partial or complete failures were registered in 12% of the cases. Severe complications did not occur.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
