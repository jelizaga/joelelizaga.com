[Article in German].  <I>Anaesthesist</I> 1981;  0(7):  39-41.<P>The 3 in 1 block provides effective analgesia for the greater part of the lower limb. The technique is simple, it requires no special positioning and because of the favorable anatomical situation of the femoral nerve it has a particularly low complication rate. The prompt administration in the acute situation considerably reduces the symptoms and consequences of traumatic shock. One should always bear in mind this effect regional anaesthetic technique in elderly patients with fractured neck of femur. The 3 in 1 block enables almost painfree positioning of the side for the performance of spinal and epidural anaesthesia. Finally the 3 in 1 block can be a most potent method of analgesia in postoperative pain. With its minimal effects on vasomotor tone and bladder function the 3 in 1 block is in many cases preferable to continuous blockade via an epidural catheter.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
