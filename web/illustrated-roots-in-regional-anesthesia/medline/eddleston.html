A double-blind comparison of 0.25% ropivacaine and 0.25% bupivacainefor extradural analgesia in labour. <I>Br-J-Anaesth.</I> 1996 Jan. 76(1).P 66-71.</CODE><P><CODE>Ropivacaine is a new aminoamide local anaesthetic. Compared withbupivacaine, ropivacaine possesses a higher threshold for systemic toxicityand a high selectivity for sensory fibres. We have compared prospectivelythese two agents in a concentration of 0.25% for extradural analgesia inlabour. A total of 104 parturients requesting extradural analgesia wererandomized to receive either ropivacaine or bupivacaine. The women in thebupivacaine group required more top-up doses to maintain analgesia (median3.0 vs 2.0) (P &lt;0.05). The onset of sensory block, quality of analgesia,ultimate level of maximum sensory block and maternal satisfaction were similarin both groups. The incidence, intensity and duration of motor block wereslightly but not significantly less in the ropivacaine group. The ropivacainegroup had a higher incidence of spontaneous vaginal delivery (70.59% vs 52.00%).There was no significant difference in neonatal outcome as assessed by Apgarscores, umbilical acid-base status and neurological and adaptive capacityscore at 2 and 24 h after delivery. We conclude that ropivacaine and bupivacainein a concentration of 0.25% produced comparable analgesia for pain reliefof labour with no detectable adverse effect on the neonate. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
