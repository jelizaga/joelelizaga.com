Myocardial uptake of bupivacaine: II.Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bupivacaine enantiomers in the isolatedperfused rabbit heart. <I>Anesth-Analg.</I> 1993 Sep. 77(3). P 477-82.</CODE><P><CODE> The enantiomers of a racemic drug generally differ in theirpharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties. Because bupivacaine isa mixture of two optical isomers known to exert different toxic propertieson isolated nerve preparations, we decided to use an isolated rabbit heartmodel with constant coronary inflow to compare the myocardial uptake kineticsof the R(+)-, S(-)-enantiomers and the racemic mixture of bupivacaine. Theincrease in QRS duration was also measured, and the inflow concentration-effectrelationship was analyzed for the three drugs. The racemic and the twoenantiomers of bupivacaine exhibited similar myocardial pharmacokineticswith a two-compartment profile for all hearts except one. All drugs showeda rapid decrease in the outflow concentration when drug administration wasdiscontinued. The tissue/perfusate concentration ratio at steady state wassimilar for the three drugs. QRS widening, as well as the occurrence of severearrhythmias, was much less pronounced in the hearts receiving the S(-) isomerthan in the hearts receiving the R(+) isomer or the racemic mixture. Despitethe occurrence of arrhythmias, QRS widening was adequately modelled withan Emax model. C50, the inflow perfusate concentration producing half Emax(maximal theoretical increase in QRS duration) was the same for all threedrugs. The authors conclude that the S(-)-bupivacaine exerts less detrimentaleffects on the isolated heart of the rabbit perfused at a constant coronaryflow with protein-free buffer. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
