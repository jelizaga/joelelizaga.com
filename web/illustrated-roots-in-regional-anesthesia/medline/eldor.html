Case report.  <I>Reg Anesth</I> 1994 Nov;19(6):418-422 </CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES.   A case of delayed respiratory arrest in the combined spinal-epiduralanesthesia (CSEA) is described. This event was likely due to morphine injected through the epiduralcatheter, unintentionally entering into the subarachnoid space through the hole in the dura that wasmade previously by the spinal needle in the needle-through-needle technique. </CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. The CSEA is apopular new regional anesthesia that combines the benefits of the spinal and epidural injections. Theneedle-through-needle technique, which is only one of the various techniques to accomplish CSEA, mayincrease the risk of unintentionally allowing the entry of the epidural catheter into the subarachnoidspace because the spinal needle and epidural catheter have the same pathway. </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS. This is thesecond case report of this event with the needle-through-needle technique. The FDA has recentlyapproved this needle-through-needle technique. CONCLUSIONS. Careful attention to technique isnecessary with utilization of CSEA. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
