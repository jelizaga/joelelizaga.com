Continuous blockade of the lumbar plexus after knee surgery--postoperative  analgesia and bupivacaine plasma concentrations. A controlled clinical trial.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1988;  43(12):  1015- 8.<P>In a double blind, randomised, controlled investigation the analgesic effect of a continuous block of the lumbar plexus with bupivacaine compared with sodium chloride was examined in 20 patients with postoperative pain after knee-joint surgery. The infusion was given through a catheter inserted in the neurovascular fascial sheath of the femoral nerve, according to the  three-in-one block technique. The patients treated with bupivacaine had  significantly lower pain scores and a significantly lower demand for morphine.  Side effects related to the catheters or the infusions of bupivacaine were not observed.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
