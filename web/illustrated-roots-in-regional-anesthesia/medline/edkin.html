Femoral nerve block as an alternative to parenteral narcotics for pain control after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.  <I>Arthroscopy</I> 1995 Aug;  11(4):  404-9.<P>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is associated with significant postoperative pain, usually requiring parenteral narcotics. A prospective study of arthroscopically assisted autograft patellar tendon ACLR was initiated using Winnie's "three-in-one" femoral nerve block (FNB) as the primary means of postoperative pain control. Patient satisfaction and absence of parenteral narcotic use indicated clinical success. Of 24 patients studied, 92% had no parenteral narcotics administered following FNB. Ninety-five percent of patients believed FNB was beneficial and would request another. The average duration of pain control was 29 hours and the majority of patients (79%) believed discharge was possible within 23 hours. There were two patients who failed to respond to FNBs (8%) and no major complications. FNB is a safe, reliable, and effective form of analgesia following ACLR, eliminating the need for parenteral narcotics.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
