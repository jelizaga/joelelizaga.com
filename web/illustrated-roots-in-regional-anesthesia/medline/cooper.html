Orthopedic Trauma Association Meeting, Sept 1996.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND:  Calcaneus fracture repair generates severe postop pain.  We aimed to compare two kinds of postop pain relief:  morphine alone vs. morphine and one-shop perioperative sciatic nerve blockade (SNB).  We also compared preop vs. postop blocks to investigate any preemptive analgesia effect.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS:  Following human subjects committee approval and written informed consent, thirty patients undergoing internal fixation of calcaneus fractures were studied.  Anesthesia was induced with 1-4 mcg/kg fentanyl and thiopental 4-7 mg/kg, and maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen and isoflurane 0.5-2.5% (end tidal concentration).  No opioid was used for maintenace anesthesia.  Patients were randomized blindly into three groups.  All groups had IV PCA morphine for postop analgesia.  Group 1 had no SNB.    Group 2 had one shot  SNB performed after induction prior to surgery.  Group 3 had SNB performed after surgery prior to anesthesia emergence.  Nerve blockade using the Labat approach was with 25 cc 1/2 % bupivacaine (with epinephrine) after nerve location via peripheral nerve stimulation.  Patients with uncontrollable pain received ketorolac as rescue medication.  Data collected included morphine use in 48 hours, visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) (0-100 mm) over 24 hours, patient satisfaction, block duration, patient state of alertness in the Recovery Room (RR).   Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, repeated meaures ANOVA, and Fishers exact test.  A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant.  </CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS:  Twenty-eight patients successfully completed the study.  Block duration was 14.1 hrs.  Sciatic nerve blockade produced better quality analgesia with fewer side effects than did PCA morphine alone (Table 1).  Patient satisfaction was higher in groups 2 and 3.  Postsurgical block was preferred by patients.  Preemptive analgesia effect could not be shown.  </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSION:  One shot sciatic nerve block at the end of surgery confers significant benefits to patients undergoing internal fixation of calcaneus fractures.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
