P 747-52.</CODE><P><CODE>An anatomical study of the lumbar epidural space in 48 autopsy subjects was made using a method of endoscopy developed by the author called epiduroscopy. In every case there was a dorsal connective tissue band in the midline of the epidural space between the dura mater and the flaval ligaments. The appearance of the band varied from strands of connective tissue to a complete membrane. This connection fixed the dura mater to the flaval ligaments and also narrowed the epidural space in the midline.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
