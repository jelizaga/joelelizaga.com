Use of a low-power nerve stimulator during sciatic nerve block. <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1987 Mar;42(3):296-298  </CODE><P><CODE>The use of a low-power nerve stimulator to aid nerve location during theperformance of sciatic nerve block was compared with a conventionalanatomically based technique. The success rate, both in terms of the productionof an effective block and the duration of postoperative analgesia, wassignificantly higher in the stimulator groups than in the non-stimulatorgroups. The implications of the study for both clinical and teaching practiceare discussed.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
