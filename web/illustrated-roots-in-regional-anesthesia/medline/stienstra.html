Lundberg-U.  Ropivacaine 0.25% versus bupivacaine 0.25% for               continuous epidural analgesia in labor: a double-blind               comparison.<I> Anesth-Analg.</I>  1995 Feb.  80(2).  P 285-9.</CODE><P><CODE>We compared the effects of continuous epidural infusion of               ropivacaine 0.25% with bupivacaine 0.25% on pain relief               and motor block during labor, and on the neonate. Seventy-six               full-term parturients in active labor requiring epidural               analgesia were randomly allocated to receive either bupivacaine               0.25% or ropivacaine 0.25%. Fifteen minutes after a               loading dose of 10 mL of the study drug, an epidural infusion               with the same drug was started at 6-12 mL/h to maintain an               adequate block. Top-up doses of 6-10 mL were given as required.               At full cervical dilation, the epidural infusion was               discontinued. The onset of pain relief (verbal scale),               contraction pain (visual analog scale), intensity of motor               block (modified Bromage scale), and duration of motor block               were not statistically different between the groups. Apgar               scores at 1 and 5 min after delivery were comparable. There was               a higher proportion of the neonates in the ropivacaine               group (26/31 = 84%) who had a neurologic and adaptive capacity               score (NACS) > or = 35 2 h after delivery than in the               bupivacaine group (18/29 = 62%). We conclude that               ropivacaine 0.25% and bupivacaine 0.25% are equally               effective for epidural pain relief during labor.               Ropivacaine may have an advantage over bupivacaine               regarding neonatal neurobehavioral performance during the first               few hours after delivery, although further studies will be               required to substantiate this.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
