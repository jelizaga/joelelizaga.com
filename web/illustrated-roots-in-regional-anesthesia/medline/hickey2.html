A comparison of ropivacaine 0.5% and bupivacaine 0.5%               for brachial plexus block.<i>Anesthesiology.</i>  1991 Apr.  74(4).  P 639-42.</code><P><code>This study compared the effectiveness of 0.5% ropivacaine and               0.5% bupivacaine for brachial plexus block. Forty-eight               patients received a subclavian perivascular brachial plexus               block for upper-extremity surgery. One group (n = 24) received               ropivacaine 0.5% (175 mg) and a second group (n = 24) received               bupivacaine 0.5% (175 mg), both without epinephrine. Onset               times for analgesia and anesthesia in each of the C5 through T1               brachial plexus dermatomes did not differ significantly between               groups. Duration of analgesia and anesthesia was long (mean               duration of analgesia, 13-14 h; mean duration of anesthesia, 9-               11 h) and also did not differ significantly between groups.               Motor block was profound, with shoulder paralysis as well as  hand paresis developing in all of the patients in both groups.               Two patients in each group required supplemental blocks before               surgery. Ropivacaine 0.5% and bupivacaine 0.5% appeared equally               effective in providing brachial plexus anesthesia.</code></body></html>
