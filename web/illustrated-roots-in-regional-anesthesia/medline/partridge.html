Functional anatomy of the brachial plexus sheath:  implications for anesthesia. <I>Anesthesiology.</I>  1987 Jun.  66(6).  P 743-7.</CODE><P><CODE>Anatomical study of the brachial plexus of 18 cadavers was  undertaken to confirm the presence and significance of "septa"  dividing the brachial plexus or axillary sheath. Dissection  demonstrated that the sheath consists of multiple layers of  thin connective tissue surrounding the various elements of the  neurovascular bundle. These septa are incomplete, however,  forming small bubble-like pockets when solution is injected.  Single injections of methylene blue and Latex solutions into  the axillary sheath resulted in immediate dye staining of  median, radial, and ulnar nerves, despite the presence of  septa. These data demonstrate that there are connections  between compartments within the sheath and, therefore, do not  support the need for multiple injections when performing an  axillary block.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
