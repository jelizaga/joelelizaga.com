Chronotropic and inotropiceffects of ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine in the spontaneously beatingand electrically paced isolated, perfused rabbit heart. <I>Reg-Anesth.</I>1992 Jul-Aug. 17(4). P 183-92.</CODE><P><CODE> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this study was to comparethe inotropic and chronotropic effects of ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and lidocainein an isolated, spontaneously beating rabbit heart preparation. The abilityto electrically pace the heart in the presence of local anesthetic also wasexamined.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS. Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution, then exposedto ropivacaine or bupivacaine at 1, 6, or 13 micrograms/ml or lidocaine at6, 20, or 40 micrograms/ml (n = 6, each concentration). Left ventricularpressure, left ventricular dP/dt (rate of change derivation from analog waveformof the left ventricular pressure wave), pulmonary artery flow, oxygenconsumption, and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the studies.Drug exposure was for 30 minutes or until a 75% decrease in left ventricularpressure occurred.</CODE><P><CODE> RESULTS. All preparations were exposed to 1 microgram/ml bupivacaineor ropivacaine and 6 micrograms/ml lidocaine for the full 30 minutes. Atthe intermediate concentrations, only one of six bupivacaine preparations(6 micrograms/ml) survived the full 30-minute exposure period, compared tosix of six preparations for both ropivacaine (6 micrograms/ml) and lidocaine(20 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.05). Similar results were found with exposureto the highest concentrations of these local anesthetics. No electrocardiogramchanges were observed with any of the three lidocaine concentrations or withthe lowest ropivacaine and bupivacaine concentration. At the intermediateconcentration, atrioventricular conduction changes were seen with bupivacainein five of six preparations, compared to one of six ropivacaine preparations(p less than 0.05). With the high concentration, ventricular tachycardiaoccurred in four of six bupivacaine preparations, compared to zero of sixwith ropivacaine (p less than 0.05). In general, left ventricular systolicpressure, dP/dt, heart rate, and oxygen consumption were reduced during exposureto all concentrations of the three local anesthetics. The most profound effects(greater than 75% reduction) were seen with 13 micrograms/ml bupivacaine.All local anesthetics caused an increase in the voltage required to pacethe hearts via the atria. With 6 micrograms/ml bupivacaine and 13 micrograms/mlropivacaine, 50% of the preparations could not be paced via the atria; andwith 13 micrograms/ml bupivacaine, none of the preparations could be pacedvia the atria. The depressant effects of 6 micrograms/ml bupivacaine approximatedthose seen with 13 micrograms/ml ropivacaine. The reductions in oxygenconsumption and pulmonary artery flow were not significantly different betweentreatment groups.</CODE><P><CODE> CONCLUSION. The results of this study indicate that bupivacaine ismore cardiodepressant and arrhythmogenic than either ropivacaine orlidocaine.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
