Anaesthesiafor microvascular surgery in children: A combination of general anaesthesiaand axillary plexus block. <I>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand.</I>1995;39:519-22.</CODE><P><CODE> Nowadays, microvascular reconstructions are performed with high successrate even in small children. The combination of general anaesthesia and axillaryplexus block was used in this prospective study in order to achieve optimalsurgical conditions in these challenging operations. Fifteen children undereight years of age (1 - 8 years) were anaesthetized with a standard anaesthesiamethod using a combination of general anaesthesia and axillary plexus blockfor microvascular toe-to-hand transfer. The duration of anaesthesia variedbetween 7.5 - 14.5 hours (mean 11 h). The difference in peripheral skintemperature was used to indicate the difference in peripheral circulation.Due to plexus block, the mean skin temperature in the operated hand was 1.4degrees C higher than in the opposite extremity at the end of the operation.In the early postoperative phase the temperature difference increased to4.8 degrees C. (p &lt; 0.01) due to vasoconstriction in the control hand.The mean temperature in the transplant hand was 33.3 +/- 2.4 degrees C atthen end of the operation. Primary microvascular results were good in allbut two children who needed reoperations. All of the transfers survived.The mean central temperature increased progressively during the operationfrom 36.2 degrees C to 37.6 &nbsp;degrees C. One 1-year-old child developeda moderate hyperthermia of 39.1 degrees C. According to this study axillaryplexus block can be combined with general anaesthesia in prolonged microvascularoperations. When the effect of general anaesthesia ceased, the plexus blockeffectively increased peripheral circulation in the operated hand. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
