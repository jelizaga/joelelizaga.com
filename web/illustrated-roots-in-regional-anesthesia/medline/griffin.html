P 512-6.</CODE><P><CODE>Seventy-three parturients for elective Caesarean section were               allocated randomly to receive extradural block with 20 ml of               either 0.5% ropivacaine or 0.5% bupivacaine. If the               block did not reach T6 within 30 min, another 5 ml of solution               was given. If needed, a further 5 ml was given 45 min after the               main dose. The mean total dose of bupivacaine was 23.1 ml (n =               35) and of ropivacaine 23.7 ml (n = 37). There was no               significant difference between the groups in the profile of               sensory block produced. There was no significant difference in               the time of onset, or intensity of motor block between the               groups but the duration of motor block was significantly               shorter in the ropivacaine group. There was no               significant difference in neonatal outcome, as assessed by               Apgar score, umbilical cord blood-gas tensions at delivery or               the neurological and adaptive capacity score 2 and 24 h after               delivery.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
