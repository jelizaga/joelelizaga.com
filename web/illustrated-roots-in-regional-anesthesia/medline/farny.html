Posterior approach to the lumbar plexus combined with a sciatic nerve blockusing lidocaine.  <I>Can J Anaesth</I> 1994 Jun;41(6):486-491.</CODE><P><CODE>A combination of lumbar plexus block, by a posterior technique, and sciaticnerve block can be a useful technique for outpatient anaesthesia. The purposeof this study was to examine the clinical characteristics of these blocks usinglidocaine and to measure the serum lidocaine concentrations. Forty-fivepatients, undergoing lower extremity surgery, were studied. Sciatic nerve andlumbar plexus blocks were made with lidocaine, 680 mg with adrenaline 0.3 mg.For each patient the following data were collected: weight, age, sex, site ofsurgery, time to perform each block, needle depth, speed of onset of thesensory and motor blocks in the territories of the sciatic, femoral, obturatorand lateral cutaneous (sensory) nerves and postoperative analgesicrequirements. Lidocaine serum concentrations were measured in ten of thesepatients at 0, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the second block.Analgesia was complete in 88% (40/45) of the patients. The remaining fivepatients needed analgesics (fentanyl 150 micrograms or less). Despite the highdose of lidocaine, the serum concentrations were within safe limits (mean +/-SD) (CMAX = 3.66 +/- 2.21 micrograms.ml-1). Only one patient had a serumconcentration > 5 micrograms.ml-1 (CMAX  = 9.54 micrograms.ml-1). This wasassociated with a contra-lateral extension of the block. We conclude that thiscombination of blocks is a valuable alternative for unilateral lower extremityanaesthesia. However, clinicians must be aware of the implications of acontra-lateral extension of the block.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
