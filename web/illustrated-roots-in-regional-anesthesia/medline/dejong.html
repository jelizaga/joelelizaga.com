P 474-81. </CODE><P><CODE> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ropivacaine, a new local anesthetic nowunder Federal Drug Administration review for clinical release, is a uniquedrug designed to take advantage of cardiac sodium channel stereoselectivity.The Labat lecture, honoring the father of regional anesthesia, pays tributeto the master by tracing the evolution of knowledge transfer from basic sciencefrontiers to safer clinical practice. </CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: A survey was made of pertinent English-language literatureon stereoselectivity of bupivacaine isomers and the evaluation and validationof ropivacaine, including a stereoisomerism primer for the nonscientist.</CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS: A synopsis of current basic and (pre)clinical findings, preparingNorth American clinicians for the imminent introduction of ropivacaine, ispresented, along with predictions for potential clinical application. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: Bupivacaine cardiotoxicity results from prolonged sodiumchannel dwell time of the R(ectus), as compared with the S(inister),stereoisomer. Bupivacaine, like most aminoamide local anesthetics (exceptlidocaine), has a chiral (asymmetric) carbon atom where the amide linkagejoins the hydrophilic tail. Chirality yields two steric forms (S and R) whichare spatial mirror images (like the left hand trapped in a right glove) withdifferent receptor kinetics; commercial bupivacaine is the optically inactiveracemic (RS) mixture of R- and S-bupivacaine. Ropivacaine is unique in thatmembrane separation synthesis exclusively yields the S-monomer, which isa local anesthetic with lower cardiotoxic potential than racemic bupivacaine.Its immediate clinical application would be in obstetric analgesia, whereasits shorter duration of action and weaker motor block should make it usefulin ambulatory anesthesia. </CODE></BODY></HTML>
