Cardiovascular effects of two different regional anaesthetic techniques forunilateral leg surgery.  <I>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</I> 1998 Jan;42(1):80-84.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular function was assessed in 20 ASA I-II patients,scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery with tourniquet in order to comparethe haemodynamic changes induced by unilateral spinal anaesthesia and combinedsciatico-femoral nerve block.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: After baseline measurement ofcardiovascular parameters, patients were randomized to receive unilateralspinal anaesthesia or combined sciatico-femoral nerve block. Spinal anaesthesiawas obtained by 8 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% slowly injected (speed=0.02ml s[-1]) through a 25-G Whitacre spinal needle with the bevel orientatedtowards the dependent side and patients lying on their operated side for 15 min(group S, n=10). Combined sciatico-femoral nerve block was obtained by 7 mgkg(-1) of mepivacaine 2% (group NB, n=10). Haemodynamic variables were recorded5, 10, 15, and 30 min after anaesthetic injection before surgery was started.</CODE><P><CODE>RESULTS: Anthropometric data, duration of surgery and acceptability ofanaesthetic techniques were similar in the 2 groups. In 8 patients of group S,spinal block was restricted to the operated side (pinprick test and Bromagescale), while the other 2 patients developed bilateral spinal block after beingturned supine. NB patients showed no haemodynamic changes during the study,whereas patients in group S showed a small but significant decrease of meanarterial blood pressure (P<0.002 vs baseline and P<0.04 vs NB), cardiac index(P<0.01 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs NB), and stroke volume index (P<0.01 vsbaseline and P<0.01 vs NB). </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSION: Both sciatico-femoral and unilateralspinal blockade provide adequate anaesthesia for unilateral leg surgery withtourniquet. The former technique affects cardiovascular performance less thanthe latter one.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
