Alkalinisation of bupivacaine for sciatic nerve blockade.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1989 Jun;44(6):467-470</CODE><P><CODE>This double-blind study investigates the effect of pH adjustment of bupivacaine0.5% with adrenaline 1:200,000 on block latency, duration of analgesia andsystemic absorption of local anaesthetic after sciatic nerve blockade.Twenty-four adult patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups:Group A (n = 12) received bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 (pH 3.9) 2mg/kg, while Group B (n = 12) received alkalinised bupivacaine with adrenaline1:200,000 (pH 6.4) 2 mg/kg. Increasing the pH of the local anaesthetic solutionsignificantly reduced block latency from 25 minutes in Group A to 12.5 minutesin Group B (p less than 0.001) and prolonged the duration of useful analgesiafrom 14.1 hours to 18.3 hours (p less than 0.001). There was no significantdifference in plasma bupivacaine levels between the two groups. The resultsindicate that alkalinisation of bupivacaine reduces time to onset and prolongsthe duration of useful analgesia when used for sciatic nerve blockade, withoutsignificantly increasing systemic absorption.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
