P 920-3.</CODE><P><CODE>This study was undertaken to investigate the outcome of epidural catheter insertion in the sitting or lateral position in mothers during labour. An initial prospective randomised study period (144 patients) suggested that the sitting position offered some superiority over the lateral in terms of technical ease of insertion. It was concluded, by minimising the subjective aspects in a follow-up, prospective nonrandomised study period (152 patients), that the determining factor lies in the skill and experience of the anaesthetist. There was no significant difference in complication rates or maternal discomfort between the two positions in either study period.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
