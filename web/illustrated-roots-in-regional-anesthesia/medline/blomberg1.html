Advantages of the paramedian approach for lumbar epidural analgesia with catheter technique. A clinical comparison between midline and paramedian approaches.<I>Anaesthesia.</I>  1989 Sep.  44(9).  P 742-6.</CODE><P><CODE>Forty-nine patients, scheduled for transurethral resection of  the prostate or a bladder neoplasm on 50 occasions, were  studied. The patients were randomly allocated to one of the two  methods of puncture, midline or paramedian. Technical  difficulties and the occurrence of complications were recorded.  The extent of sensory and motor blockade was also compared. The  paramedian approach was associated with a lower frequency of  technical problems compared to the midline approach.  Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between  the two techniques for the following factors: repeated attempts  at needle insertion; difficulty in identification of the  epidural space; resistance to introduction of the catheter;  resistance to injection through the epidural catheter; and the  production of paraesthesiae (nine patients in the midline group  compared to only one patient in the paramedian group, p less  than 0.01). The catheter entered a vessel at first in two  patients in each group. No significant differences were  demonstrated between the groups in the extent of sensory and  motor blockade. The study supports the view that the paramedian  approach has technical advantages over the midline approach for  lumbar epidural analgesia with catheter technique.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
