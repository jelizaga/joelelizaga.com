Acutetoxicity of ropivacaine compared with that of bupivacaine. <I>Anesth Analg.</I>1989;69:536-9. <CODE></CODE></CODE><P><CODE> The acute central nervous and cardiovascular effects of the localanesthetics ropivacaine and bupivacaine were compared in 12 volunteers ina randomized double-blind manner with the use of intravenous infusions ata rte of 10 mg/min up to a maximal dose of 150 mg. The volunteers were allhealthy men. They were familiarized with the central nervous system (CNS)toxic effects of local anesthetics by receiving a preliminary intravenousinjection of lidocaine. The infusions of ropivacaine and bupivacaine weregiven not &lt;7 days apart.</CODE><P><CODE> CNS toxicity was identified by th CNS symptoms and the volunteerswere told to request that the infusion be stopped when they felt definitebut not severe symptoms of toxicity such as numbness of the mouth,lightheadedness, and tinnitus. In the absence of definite symptoms, the infusionwas stopped after 150 mg had been given.</CODE><P><CODE> Cardiovascular system (CVS) changes in conductivity and myocardialcontractility were monitored using an interpretive electrocardiograph (whichmeasured PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval corrected for heart rate)and echocardiography (which measured left ventricular dimensions from whichstroke volume and ejection fraction were calculated).</CODE><P><CODE> Ropivacaine caused less CNS symptoms and was at least 25% less toxicthan bupivacaine in regard to the dose tolerated. Both drugs increased heartrate and arterial pressure. Stroke volume and ejection fraction were reduced.There was no change in cardiac output. Although both drugs caused evidenceof depression of conductivity and contractility, these appeared at lowerdosage and lower plasma concentrations with bupivacaine that withropivacaine.</CODE><P><CODE> Ropivacaine is a less toxic compound than bupivacaine, but their relativetherapeutic ratios must await the results of clinical trials in humans toassess the potency of ropivaciane compared wth that of bupivacaine.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
