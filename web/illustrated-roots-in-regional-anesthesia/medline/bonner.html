Sciatic nerve palsy following uneventful sciatic nerve block.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1997 Dec;52(12):1205-1207.</CODE><P><CODE>We describe the loss of function in the sciatic nerve after an uneventfulsciatic nerve block using 25 ml of lignocaine 1% with adrenaline 1 in 200,000in a patient receiving beta blocker drugs. Lack of pain on injection andcomplete regeneration of the nerve after 12 months in a patient with severeperipheral vascular disease led us to postulate ischaemic nerve damage as amechanism of injury. Adrenaline-induced unopposed alpha-mediatedvasoconstriction in a beta-blocked patient is suggested as a possible mechanismof peripheral nerve injury worthy of further investigation.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
