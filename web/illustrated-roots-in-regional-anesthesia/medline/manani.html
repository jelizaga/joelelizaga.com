Sciatic nerve block by the anterior and posterior approach for operations onthe lower extremity. A comparative study.  <I>Acta Anaesthesiol Belg</I>1982;33(3):183-193.</CODE><P><CODE>The results of the analgesic block of the lower extremity by means of ananterior (150 patients) or a posterior (114 patients) approach to the sciaticnerve, associated to a "3 in 1 block" were compared. The anterior approachtechnique was associated with a higher incidence of failures, insufficientanalgesia and hence a higher demand for intraoperative analgesic and sedativedrugs. Also tolerance to a pneumatic tourniquet over the proximal thigh wasless than with the posterior approach. However, the sciatic nerve block byanterior approach granted a more prolonged analgesia. This technique wassuitable for trauma patients immobilized in the supine position, for patientswith skeletal traction on Zupinger frame, both for surgery and for closedreduction of lower extremity fractures.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
