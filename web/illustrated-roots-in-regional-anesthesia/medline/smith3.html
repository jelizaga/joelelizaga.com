Low volume, high concentration block of the sciatic nerve.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1988 Jan;43(1):8-11  </CODE><P><CODE>Sciatic nerve block was performed in two groups of patients using a low powerperipheral nerve stimulator to aid nerve location. In group A 1% prilocainewith felypressin was used as the local anaesthetic agent in a volume of 0.25ml/kg body weight. In group B 3% prilocaine with felypressin was used in avolume of 0.08 ml/kg body weight (i.e. equal total drug dosages). Use of the 3%solution resulted in highly significant reductions in the mean latency foranalgesia of the nerve block and in the latency and degree of motor blockachieved (p less than 0.005 in each case). The clinical value of highconcentration, low volume nerve block is discussed.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
