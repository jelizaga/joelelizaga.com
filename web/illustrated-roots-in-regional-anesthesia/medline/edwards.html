Continuous low-dose 3-in-1 nerve blockade for postoperative pain relief after  total knee replacement.  <I>Anesth Analg</I> 1992;  75(2):  265-7. <P>We have investigated the value of a 3-in-1 nerve block, followed by a  continuous low-dose infusion of bupivacaine into the femoral nerve sheath for  postoperative analgesia after total knee replacement. Thirty-seven patients  were randomly allocated to either a control group or a study group. The study  group had a catheter placed in the ipsilateral femoral nerve sheath. A 3-in-1  nerve block was then performed in the study group with injection of 30 mL of  0.25% bupivacaine through the catheter. This was followed by a continuous  infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 6 mL/h. The study group had significantly  lower pain scores 4 and 24 h postoperatively (P less than 0.01) and required  less postoperative opioid analgesic medication (P less than 0.01) than the  control group. The authors conclude that a continuous low-dose infusion into  the femoral nerve sheath results in better pain relief than conventional  intramuscularly administered narcotics after total knee arthroplasty.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
