P 395-406.</CODE><P><CODE>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cryomicrotome section is a means of  anatomic examination with minimal artifact ideally suited to  delineating details of tissue relationships in the epidural  space. In the past, healthy adult lumbar levels have been  studied by this method. This report extends observations to  other regions of the vertebral column, other age groups, and  some abnormal conditions.</CODE><P><CODE>METHODS: The bodies of 26 adults were frozen in toto soon after death, and the bodies of 2 children were frozen after embalming. Unstained anatomy was revealed by sectioning, and the exposed surface was photographed.</CODE><P><CODE> RESULTS: As compared with the lumbar level, there are diminished  epidural contents at the thoracic and cervical levels, and the  ligamentum flavum is more frequently discontinuous. A large  basivertebral vein with its origin in the anterior epidural  space is typical of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar levels.  Although the epidural contents are typically divided into  compartments, there is incomplete segmentation of the posterior  compartments during early childhood and often at thoracic  levels in adults. In advanced age with degenerative disc and  joint changes, distortion and compression of the epidural space are typical.</CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSIONS: Variations in epidural anatomy due to vertebral level, age, and disease may alter the ease of epidural entry and passage of catheters and injected solution.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
