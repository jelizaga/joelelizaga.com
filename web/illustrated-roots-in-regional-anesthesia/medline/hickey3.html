Plasma concentrations of ropivacaine given with or               without epinephrine for brachial plexus block.<i>Can-J-Anaesth.</I>  1990 Nov.  37(8).  P 878-82.</code><P><code> The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic               properties of the local anaesthetic ropivacaine used with or               without epinephrine for brachial plexus block. Seventeen ASA               physical status I or II adult patients undergoing elective               orthopaedic surgery received a single injection of 33 ml               ropivacaine for subclavian perivascular block and 5 ml to block               the intercostobrachial nerve in the axilla. One group (n = 8)               received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine without epinephrine (190 mg)               and the other (n = 9) received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine with               epinephrine 1:200,000 (190 mg). Plasma ropivacaine               concentrations were measured from peripheral venous blood  samples taken for 12 hr after drug administration. Ropivacaine               base was determined in plasma using gas chromatography and a               nitrogen-sensitive detector. The mean peak plasma concentration               (Cmax) was 1.6 +/- 0.6 mg.L-1 and 1.3 +/- 0.4 mg.L-1 after               administration of ropivacaine with and without epinephrine. The               median time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 0.75 hr and               0.88 hr and the mean area under the plasma concentration curve               AUC0-12h was 7.7 +/- 3.6 and 7.0 +/- 3.4 mg.l hr-1. The               differences were not statistically significant. The terminal               phase of the individual plasma concentration-time curves showed               a varying and sometimes slow decline possibly indicating a               sustained systemic uptake of ropivacaine from the brachial               plexus. No central nervous system or cardiovascular symptoms               attributed to systemic plasma concentrations of the drug were               observed, with the dose (1.90-3.28 mg.kg-1) of ropivacaine               used. It is concluded that the addition of epinephrine does not               alter the pharmacokinetic properties of ropivacaine when used for subclavian perivascular brachial plexus block.</code></body></html>
