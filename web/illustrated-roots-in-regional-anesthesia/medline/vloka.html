Femoral and genitofemoral nerve blocks versus spinal anesthesia for outpatients  undergoing long saphenous vein stripping surgery.    <I>Anesth Analg</I> 1997;  84(4):  749-52.<P>Long saphenous vein stripping (LSVS) surgery is often used to treat varicose  veins. We tested the hypothesis that femoral nerve block (FNB) with  genitofemoral nerve infiltration provides sufficient analgesia and superior  recovery characteristics to spinal anesthesia for LSVS procedures in the  ambulatory setting. Thirty-six patients were randomized to receive FNB with 30  mL of 3% alkalinized chloroprocaine, and 32 patients received spinal anesthesia  with 65 mg of 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. Data collected included patient  demographics, time required for induction of and recovery from anesthesia,  postoperative anesthesia complications, and patient report of pain severity  after the operation. During a follow-up call, a blinded observer noted the  onset of any complications, the requirement for analgesics, and the patients'  satisfaction with the anesthetic technique. Patients in the FNB group had  significantly faster recovery (P < 0.01) and lower incidences of pain (P <  0.05) and complications (P < 0.05) than the patients in the spinal group. All  patients who received FNB indicated that they would choose this type of  anesthesia in the future, whereas five (15%) patients in the spinal group would  refuse spinal anesthesia in the future (P < 0.01). We conclude that FNB is an  excellent anesthetic choice for LSVS.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
