A comparison of two approaches to sciatic nerve block.  <I>Anaesthesia</I> 1992 Feb;47(2):155-157.</CODE><P><CODE>This study compared the posterior and popliteal fossa approaches for sciaticnerve block. Patients scheduled to undergo foot surgery were allocated randomlyinto one of two groups: group A (n = 20) received sciatic nerve block via theposterior approach and group B (n = 20) received a block using the poplitealfossa approach. All blocks were performed with the aid of a peripheral nervestimulator and alkalinised 0.5% bupivacaine with 1 in 200,000 adrenaline wasinjected in a dose of 2 mg.kg-1. Nineteen of 20 blocks in group A weresuccessful compared with nine of 20 in group B (p less than 0.01). There was nosignificant difference between the groups in respect of time to onset orduration of block. Patients in group B reported less discomfort duringperformance of the sciatic nerve block but required supplementary nerve blocksmore frequently. We recommend the use of the posterior approach for sciaticnerve block.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
