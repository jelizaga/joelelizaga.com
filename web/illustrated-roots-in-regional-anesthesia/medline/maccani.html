Femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block for muscle biopsies in children.  <I>Paediatr Anaesth</I> 1995;5(4):223-7.<P>Retrospective chart review (1978-1993) of 179 children less than age 18 (10.0 +/- 3.8 SD yrs) undergoing muscle biopsy for determination of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia provided data. One hundred and forty-six patients received femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks as their primary anaesthetic. We examined age, weight, duration of surgery, time to discharge from hospital, choice and dosage of local anaesthetics, choice and dosage of sedation, postoperative pain medications, and complications. All children receiving this form of anaesthesia remained outpatients. Between 1978 and 1985 procaine (10 mg.kg-1) with hyaluronidase or 2-chloroprocaine (12 mg.kg-1) provided nerve blockade; after 1985, lignocaine (6.8 mg.kg-1), or a combination of lignocaine or mepivacaine and 2-chloroprocaine, were the preferred agents. More recently the combination of 2-chloroprocaine and bupivacaine has been popular. Three patients required admission to the recovery room postoperatively, due to heavy sedation. Forty-three children (29%) received pain medication during recovery. Femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous block anaesthesia with light to moderate sedation is well tolerated in children undergoing anterior thigh procedures.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
