Arch Emerg Med 1988;  5(3):  173-176  Femoral nerve block for analgesia in fractures of the femoral neck.<P>The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of femoral nerve blocks in patients with fractures of the neck of the femur. Thirty-six patients with femoral neck fractures attending the accident department over a three month period received femoral blocks from one of the two authors. The effect of the block was assessed both subjectively and objectively. Thirty patients reported a worthwhile reduction in pain following the procedure and this was supported by objective blockade in 29. In all six patients who reported no benefit, the block failed objectively. There were no complications of the procedure.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
