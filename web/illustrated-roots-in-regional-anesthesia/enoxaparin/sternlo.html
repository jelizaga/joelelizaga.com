Spinal subdural bleeding after attempted epidural and subsequent spinal anaesthesia in a patient on thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. [case report]<I>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. </I> 1995;39:P 557-9.</CODE><P><CODE> Despite the extensive use if low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for thrombophrophylaxis, only two serious complications have thus far been reported where spinal hematomas were incurred after epidural and spinal blocks in patients on such treatment.  In our patient, who was on thromboprophylaxis with the LMWH drug enoxaparin, catheter epidural anaesthesia was abandoned due to a bloody tap and superseded by spinal anaesthesia.  More than 40 hours later she had developed a paraparesis and complete sensory loss in the lower  extremities.  The MRT image showed hematomas epi- and subdurally, as well as subarachnoidally, but no epidurla bleeding was seen at laminectomy.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
