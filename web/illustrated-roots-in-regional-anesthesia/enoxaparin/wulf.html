Epidural anaesthesia and spinal hematoma [review]<I>Can J Anaesth. </I> 1996;43(12):1260-71</CODE><P><CODE> PURPOSE:  Haematoma formation in the spinal canal due to epidural anaesthesia is a very rare but serious complication.  This paper presents a comprehensive review of case reports.</CODE><P><CODE>SOURCE:  Sampling of case reports over a 10 yr period, medline-research (1966-1995) and cross-check with former reviews.</CODE><P><CODE>FINDINGS:  Fifty-one confirmed spinal haematomas associated with epidural anaesthesia were found.  Most were related to the insertion of a catheter, a procedure that was graded as difficult or traumatic in 21 patients.  Other risk factors were: fibrinolytic therapy (n=2), previously unknown spinal pathology (n=2), low molecular weight heparin (n=2), aspirin or other NSAID (n=3), epidural catheter inserted during general anaesthesia (n=3), thrombocytopenia (n=5), ankylosing spondylitis (n=5), preexisting coagulopathy (n=14), and intravenous heparin therapy (n=18).</CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSION:  Coagulopathies or anticoagulant therapy (e.g., full heparinization) were the predominant risk factors, whereas low-dose heparin thromboprophylaxis or NSAID treatment was rarely associated with spinal bleeding complications.  Ankylosing spondylitis was identified as a new, previously unreported risk factor.  Analysis of reported clinical practice suggests an incidence of haematoma of 1:190,000 epidurals.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
