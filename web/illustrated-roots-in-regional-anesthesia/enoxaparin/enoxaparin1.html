She was the restrained front-seat passenger  in a "T-bone" collision which impacted the passenger side of her vehicle.  Except for diffuse contusions and abrasions her only injuries consisted of a right-sided hemo-pneumothorax and fractures of the second through eighth ribs.   She underwent right chest tube thoracostomy in the emergency room. <BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="1">On the morning after admission the Pain Relief Service  was consulted for management of pain related to her thoracic injuries.   Parenteral  morphine administered on a PRN basis over the previous night provided inadequate analgesia and resulted in excessive sedation.   The patient's oxygen saturation on nasal cannula oxygen at 4L/min flow was 94%, and occasional desaturation to the upper 80s occurred with movement.  She exhibited splinting with inspiration and was unwilling to cough due to chest pain.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="1">In light of her deteriorating pulmonary function and localized site of injury, placement of a thoracic epidural catheter for continuous analgesia was planned.  Recent coagulation studies including  protime, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count were normal.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="1">An epidural catheter was placed at the T7-T8 interspace using the paramedian approach and loss of resistance technique.  An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was redirected 6-7 times to "walk off" the lamina, but placement of the needle into the epidural space was atraumatic.  A 20-gauge epidural catheter threaded easily.  Four milliliters of  2% lidocaine with epinephrine were then administered and a T3-T8 bilateral block resulted with effective analgesia.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="1">It was then noted that the patient had received enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously at 9 o'clock, 6 hours prior to epidural catheter placement.<A NAME="questions"></A><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="1" VSPACE="15"><BR>  </TD>  </TR>  <TR>  <TD WIDTH="91"><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="50" VSPACE="1"></TD><TD WIDTH="336"> QUESTIONS<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><A HREF="enoxaparin3.html"><B>1.
