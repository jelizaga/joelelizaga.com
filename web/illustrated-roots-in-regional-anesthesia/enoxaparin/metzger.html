Spinal epidural hematoma following epidural anesthesia versus spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma.  Two case reports.<I>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. </I> 1991;35:105-7.</CODE><P><CODE> Two cases of lumbar hemorrhage with subsequent persistent neurological sequelae are presented and their possible causes are discussed in the context of a literature review:  one patient with spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma with no trauma or lumbar puncture and one with spinal epidural hematoma associated with preceding  epidural catheterization for postoperative pain relief.  The subdural hematoma was associated with a thrombocytopenia of about 90 000/µl due to intraoperative blood loss.  This might have been contributory to the formation or expansion of the hematoma, but it is not convincing since a platelet count of this amount should not lead to spontaneous bleeding.  Both patients received low-dose heparin, but since coagulation tests were normal, prolonged bleeding does not appear to be a likely cause, although it cannot be excluded.  In conclusion, the reasons for both hematoma remain unclear.  With regard to the epidural hematoma and low-dose heparinization, the possible coincidence of spontaneous lumbar hematoma and lumbar regional block should be taken into consideration.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
