Low molecular weight heparins are fragments of heparin of about 5000 Daltons produced by the controlled enzymatic or chemical depolymerization of unfractionated heparin chains.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="0">Heparin exerts its anticoagulant activity by potentiating the action of antithrombin III, which acts to inhibit thrombin (factor IIa) and activated factor X (Xa).  In contrast to unfractionated heparin which has equivalent activity on thrombin and Xa,  low molecular weight heparin has proportionately more activity against Xa than against thrombin.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="0">Low molecular weight heparin differs from unfractionated heparin by its higher bioavailability, longer  plasma half life (2 to 4 hours following intravenous injection and 3 to 6 hours following subcutaneous injection), and dose-independent clearance.  The greater bioavailability and more predictable pharmacokinetics of low-molecular weight heparin are a consequence of its reduced binding to plasma proteins, endothelium, and macrophages.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="0">Binding to platelets is also less with low molecular weight heparin than with unfractionated heparin.  Consequently, inhibition of platelet activity is decreased.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia also occurs less frequently with low molecular weight heparin than with unfractionated heparin.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="0">Low molecular weight heparins have proven more effective than unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis following total knee and total hip arthroplasty as well as following general surgery.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="20"><BR>REFERENCES<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="10"><BR>1.
