Low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis and epidural/spinal aaesthesia - is there a risk? [review]<I>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. </I> 1992. 36. P 605-9.</CODE><P><CODE> This article reviews the problem of bleeding in connection with epidural/spinal anesthesia,  with special emphasis on the use of low molecular weight heparins for thromboprophylaxis.  There are methodological difficulties to studying the problem in a scientifically correct way because of the rarity of the complication.  However, from the data in the literature there are no indications of an increased risk in using the combination of low molecular weight heparin in prophylactic doses and epidural/spinal anaesthesia. So far, there is only a single case report, of spinal hematoma, although low molecular weight heparins have been used in combination with epidural/spinal anaesthesia in at least 1000000 patients.  in controlled studies, at least 10000 patients have been given the combination without complications.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
