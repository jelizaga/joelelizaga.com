Intrathecal catheter insertion during labour reduces the risk of post-dural puncture headache.  <I>Can J Anaesth</I> 1998;45(1):42-5.</CODE><P><CODE>PURPOSE: To describe the anaesthetic management and report the incidence of PDPH in three parturients who had experienced accidental dural puncture during labour and the subsequent deliberate intrathecal insertion of an epidural catheter. </CODE><P><CODE>CLINICAL FEATURES: Inadvertent dural puncture with a 16-gauge Tuohy needle occurred during the first stage of labour at 3-4 cm cervical dilatation in all three women. The 20-gauge epidural catheter was immediately inserted into the subarachnoid space after accidental dural penetration. Intermittent intrathecal injections of lidocaine or bupivacaine with fentanyl were administered to provide analgesia during labour and delivery. Two of the women had spontaneous vaginal deliveries, whereas Caesarean section was performed in one case due to acute fetal distress during the second stage of labour. The intrathecal catheter was left in-situ for 13-19 hr after delivery and the women were questioned daily for symptoms of PDPH. None of the three women developed PDPH after dural puncture and intrathecal catheterisation with the epidural catheter. </CODE><P><CODE>CONCLUSION: Immediate intrathecal insertion of the epidural catheter after accidental dural puncture during labour proved to be an effective prophylactic technique to prevent PDPH in these three parturients.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
