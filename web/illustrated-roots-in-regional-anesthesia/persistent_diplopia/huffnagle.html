The influence of epidural needle bevel orientation on spread of sensory blockade in the laboring parturient.  <I>Anesth Analg</I>1998;87(2):326-30.</CODE><P><CODE>Both asymmetrical sensory blockade and dural puncture are undesirable outcomes of epidural analgesia. Identifying the epidural space with the needle bevel oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the patient's back limits the risk of headache in the event of dural puncture. However, rotating the bevel to direct a catheter cephalad may risk dural puncture. We prospectively studied the effects of needle rotation on the success of labor epidural analgesia and on the incidence of dural puncture. One hundred sixty ASA physical status I or II laboring parturients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The epidural space was identified with the bevel of an 18-gauge Hustead needle directed to the patient's left. It was then rotated as follows: Group 0 = no rotation, final bevel orientation left (n = 39); Group 90 = rotation 90 degrees clockwise, bevel cephalad (n = 43); Group 180 = rotation 180 degrees clockwise, bevel right (n = 36); Group 270 = rotation 270 degrees clockwise, bevel caudad (n = 42). A single-orifice catheter was inserted 3 cm, and analgesia was induced in a standardized fashion. Dural puncture was evenly distributed among the groups (4.4%). There were more dermatomal segments blocked, fewer one-sided blocks, and more patients comfortable at 30 min with the needle bevel directed cephalad. Using a catheter inserted through a needle oriented in the cephalad direction increases the success of epidural analgesia. Implications: This prospective study shows that an epidural catheter inserted through a needle oriented in the cephalad direction increases the success of labor analgesia in the parturient. Carefully rotating the needle cephalad does not increase the risk of dural puncture, intravascular catheters, or failed blocks.</CODE></BODY></HTML>
