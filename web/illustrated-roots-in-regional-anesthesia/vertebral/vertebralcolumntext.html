The vertebral column has four characteristic curvatures: the anterior convexity of the sacrum, the lumbar lordosis, the thoracic kyphosis, and the cervical lordosis. In the supine patient, the lumbar spine has its highest point at L4 and the thoracic spine has its lowest point at T4. In the lumbar area, the spinous processes project directly posteriorly whereas in the thoracic area, the spinous processes project posteriorly and more inferiorly until they reach their steepest downward angulation at the midthoracic level where they overlap with the lamina of the vertebra immediately inferior. This overlap can make the midline approach to the epidural space difficult or impossible at the T5-T9 levels. At higher thoracic levels, the spinous processes become level again to become nearly horizontal at C7. The spinal canal is enclosed by the vertebral bodies anteriorly, the pedicles laterally, and the ligamenta flava and the laminae posteriorly. The canal ends superiorly in the foramen magnum and inferiorly in the sacral hiatus.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Ligaments</B></FONT><BR>The supraspinous ligament runs along the tips of the spinous processes and  blends with the ligamentum nuchae at its superior end. In elderly individuals  and in persons who engage in heavy physical activity, the ligament can become  ossified, making a midline approach to the epidural space impossible. The  interspinous ligament stretches vertically from the inferior border of each  spinous process to the superior border of the spinous process below, except  in the cervical spine, where it is absent. Dorsally, the interspinous ligament  blends with the supraspinous ligament. Ventrally, it fuses with the ligamenta  flava and the laminae. The laminae slope posteriorly and inferiorly so that  their ventral surfaces are in close contact with the dura. The ligamentum  flavum is a tough elastic ligament that attaches to the ventral surface of  the superior lamina and the dorsal surface of the inferior lamina. Laterally,  the ligament thins as it blends with the joint capsule of the articular  processes. Within the spinal canal, the posterior longitudinal ligament runs  along the dorsal surface of the vertebral bodies and is adherent to the anterior  dura. The anterior longitudinal ligament joins the vertebral bodies along  their anterior surface.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Dura Mater</FONT></B><BR> The dura mater is a tough fibrous membrane that envelopes the arachnoid mater,  cerebrospinal fluid, pia mater, spinal nerves, spinal cord and brain. Within  the cranium, the dura is composed of an outer endosteal component that lies  against the bone of the cranium and an inner meningeal component. These two  layers are tightly adherent except where they divide to form the venous sinuses.  At the foramen magnum, the endosteal layer divides from the meningeal layer  and lines the spinal canal as the endosteum of the vertebral bodies. The  meningeal layer continues caudally as the dural sac, and ends at the S2 level  in adults. The attachment of the meningeal dura to the endosteal dural at  the foramen magnum anatomically isolates the cranial vault from the epidural  space of the spinal canal.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Arachnoid Mater</B></FONT><BR> The arachnoid mater is a thin metabolically active membrane that loosely  adheres to the dural sac and contains the brain and spinal cord bathed in  CSF. Between the arachnoid and the dura lies the subdural space, a potential  space through which local anesthetics can distribute via a misplaced spinal  needle or epidural catheter. Connective tissue trabeculae extend from the  arachnoid to the pial surface of the spinal cord to secure the cord in the  CSF. Arachnoid granulations ranging from microscopic to 3 mm in diameter  cluster around the nerve roots in the dural cuff region. These granulations  emerge through the dura and press into surrounding veins and epidural fat.  By transcellular vacuolar transport, the granulations clear the CSF of foreign  particulate material, likely by emptying directly into the epidural venous  plexus or into the epidural connective tissue, for subsequent removal by  lymphatic drainage.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Pia Mater and Spinal Cord</FONT></B><BR>The pia mater is a thin highly vascular membrane composed of flat epithelial cells and tightly adherent to the spinal cord. A long filamentous extension of the pia, the filum terminale, pierces the caudal end of the dural sac  and blends with the periosteum of the coccyx to secure the spinal cord within the sac. The spinal cord ends at the L1-2 level in adults. The spinal roots continue  caudally to the intervertebral foramina of the lower lumbar and sacral levels as the cauda equina.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="../epidural/epiduralspaceframes.html"  target="_top">EPIDURAL SPACE</A><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10"><A HREF="../Page1.html" TARGET="_top">HOME</A></FONT></BODY></HTML>
