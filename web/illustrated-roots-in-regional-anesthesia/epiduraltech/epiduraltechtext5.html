There are casereports of total spinal anesthesia occuring after doses as small as 45 mgof lidocaine in parturients, so some caution is advised.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Local Anesthetic with Epinephrine</B></FONT><br>Injection of 15 &#181;g of epinephrine as a test dose is a common techniquefor determining intravascular placement of epidural catheters. In healthynonpreganant adults, either 10 or 15 &#181;g of epinephrine producesstatistically significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Themean maximal increase in heart rate after an intravenous epinephrine mixedwith local anesthetics is 29-49 bpm and 29-46 bpm for 10 and 15 &#181;g ofepinephrine, respectively.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/guinard.html" target="image">19</A></SUP>  Blood pressure also increases by 13-30 mm Hg and 18-33 mm Hg with 10 and 15 &#181;g epinephrine, respectively.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/guinard.html" target="image">19</A></SUP><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>A widely accepted definition of a positive response to a test dose is a risein heart rate 20 bpm above baseline. Since increasing the test does to 15&#181;g of epinephrine did not statistically or clincially improve the abilityto detect intravascular injection, 10 &#181;g of epinephrine could also serveas an effective test dose.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>When performing test doses, symptoms of intravenous epinephrine injectioncan also be elicited from the patient. Common clinical symptoms and signsinclude palpitations, headache, chest pain, dysphoria, pallor, and tremulousness.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Local Anesthetic Alone</B></FONT><BR>Local anesthetics alone have been recommended as agents in test doses when sudden increase in heart rate or blood pressure may be detrimental (e.g., severe preeclampsia). Lidocaine 100 mg is injected and subjective symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity are elicited from the patient (tinnitus, perioral numbness or tingling, metallic taste, dizziness). The sensitivity of this test ranges from 50-80%.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Air Test</B></FONT><BR>In the air test for intravascular placement, 1 ml of air is injected throughthe epidural catheter while continuously listening to heart tones with aprecordial ultrasound Doppler probe for 15 seconds. An investigation intothe safety and efficacy of the air test in parturients determined that thetest had an apparent sensitivity of 100% (it was positive whenever IV injection could be documented by any other means) and a specificity of 98% (the test was falsely positive in 6/281 patients).<SUP><A HREF="../medline/leighton.html" target="image">20</A></SUP>  None of the 303 patients receivingthe air test developed any complications from the technique.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Use of Epinephrine in the Presence of &szlig;-Blockade</B></FONT><BR>In the presence of &szlig;-blockade, changes in heart rate cannot be reliedon as an indicator of intravascular placement. Systolic blood pressure increasedbut heart rate did not when healthy nonpregnant volunteers were premedicatedwith a &szlig;1-specific &szlig;-blocker (esmolol) or with a nonspecific&szlig;-blocker (propranolol) when 5, 10, and 15 &#181;g of epinephrine wereinjected intravenously.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/guinard.html" target="image">19</A></SUP>  An increasein SBP &gt;15 mm Hg was recommended as criteria for determining intravascularplacement. The investigators cautioned that these results may not be applicableto elderly individuals who may not respond with an increase in blood pressure.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Use of the Epinephrine Test Dose Under General Anesthesia</B></FONT><BR>General anesthesia attentuates the hemodynamic response to an intravenousepinephrine test dose, although modification of the the response may dependon the depth and type of anesthetic.
