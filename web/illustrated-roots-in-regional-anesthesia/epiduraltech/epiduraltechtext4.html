Several tests have been described to determine whether this fluid is CSF or local anesthetic, including the determination of the fluid temperature, glucose concentration, pH, and presence of turbidity after mixing with thiopental. When these tests were compared for accuracy, temperature difference resulted in correct identification of the two solutions in 75% of cases, the presence of glucose in 92%, pH in 83%, and turbidity in 25%.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/tessler.html" target="image">17</A></SUP>  Although a sensitive test for CSF, the glucose test may be misleading. The glucose test was positive in 23/43 obstetric patients who underwent epidural anesthesia for labor analgesiaor cesarean section, yet none developed total spinal anesthesia or experienced postdural puncture headache.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/waters.html" target="image">18</A></SUP>  Normal CSF drainage into the epidural space may be a potential source of glucose.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Performing more than one physicochemical test is probably required to correctly differentiate between CSF and local anesthetic when small volumes of liquid are aspirated from the catheter.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="15" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="epiduraltechtext5.html">EPIDURAL TEST DOSES</A><FONT><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="epiduraltechtext3.html">PREVIOUS</A><FONT><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="../Page1.html" TARGET="_top">HOME</A><FONT></BODY></HTML>
