Depth of the needle in the supraspinous ligament is limited to 2 cm before the stylet is removed. A 5 or 10 ml saline-filled loss of resistance syringe is then attached to the needle hub.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Authorities recommend that the anesthesiologist stand when advancing the needle for the loss of resistance.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bromage.html" target="image">3</A>,<A HREF="../medline/moore.html" target="image">5</A></SUP><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Bromage describes the technique as follows: <BLOCKQUOTE>"The needle is gripped with the thumb on top and the proximal and distal phalanges of the crooked forefinger below. The hand is supinated and the wrist partially flexed and the back of the carpus braced against the patient's back. Forward motion is imparted on the needle by a gradual extension of the wrist, and the carpus and metacarpus roll in toward the back like an eccentric cam driving a piston".<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bromage.html" target="image">3</A></SUP>  (<A HREF="epiduralgrip.html" target="image">Figure 4</A>)</BLOCKQUOTE>  <BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" width="1" height="10"><BR>The nondominant hand rests against the patient's back and stabilizes the needle to prevent any sudden forward motion. Constant unremitting pressure is placed on the plunger of the saline-filled syringe with the thumb (<A HREF="epidurallor.html" target="image">Figure 5</A>). <BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR> A sudden loss of resistance is felt when the bevel pierces the ligamentum flavum. Injection, which was previously obstructed, should suddenly become "as easy as discharging the syringe into an empty space".<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bromage.html" TARGET="image">3</A></SUP>  The forward motion of the needle should be stopped immediately. The jet of saline pushes the dura away from the advancing needle. The average depth of the epidural space measures 5 cm with a range between 2 - 8.5 cm. No CSF or blood should flow from the needle after the syringe is detached from the hub.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR> Rotation of the needle during needle advancement and after entering the epidural space may increase the likelihood of lacerating epidural veins as well as the dura.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/duffy.html" target="image">7</A></SUP> Subdural or subarachnoid placement of the needle bevel and epidural catheter may result.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR> The rebound test may confirm entry into the epidural space.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bromage.html" target="image">3</A></SUP>  One to 1.5 ml of air is rapidly injected into the space through the needle and the pressure on the plunger quickly released. A glass syringe will refill with only 0.1-0.2 ml of air. If the needle is incorrectly placed in a ligament, the syringe will refill with 0.5-1.0 ml. Injection of 1 to 2 ml of sterile water has also been described as a test to confirm epidural placement. Water produces pain in the awake subject, and reflex movements in lightly anesthetized patients.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Some anesthesiologists recommend injection of a volume of saline or part of the initial dose of local anesthetic through the needle prior to threading the catheter. This may open up the epidural space, facilitate passage of the catheter, decrease the incidence of paresthesias and intravenous cannulation, and shorten the onset of the initial dose. The incidence of intravenous cannulation is decreased significantly (1% vs 14%) when 10 ml of saline are injected through the needle, but is no different when volumes of less than 10 ml are injected prior to catheter insertion.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/scott2.html" target="image">8</A>,<A HREF="../medline/rolbin.html" target="image">9</A>,<A HREF="../medline/tseng.html" target="image">10</A></SUP><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>A 20 gauge epidural catheter is threaded through the needle with attention paid to the depth markings on the catheter. Moderate pressure might be required to pass the catheter tip beyond the orifice of the needle, but only light and delicate pressure should be needed to advance it further. Catheter advancement frequently produces a mild paresthesia described as a poorly localized burning sensation radiating to the hip or leg.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/hetherington.html" target="image">11</A></SUP>  The optimal distance in the space probably ranges between 2-6 cm.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>The potential for shearing the catheter with the needle exists once the tip of the catheter has passed the bevel of the needle.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bromage.html" target="image">3</A></SUP>  The catheter should not be removed with the needle left in place.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>The catheter is grasped at its entry into the skin between the thumb and index finger as the needle is removed. The depth of the catheter at the skin is noted.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Spontaneous flow of CSF or blood from the catheter should be absent when the end of the catheter is held in a dependent position. An aspiration test for CSF or blood is attempted with a 3 ml syringe. Following a negative aspiration, an appropriate test dose is administered.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>The catheter is secured to the skin using benzoin and a transparent dressing. A loop in the catheter as it exits the skin may prevent outward migration of the catheter by absorbing sudden tension placed on the proximal end of the catheter (<A HREF="epiduralcurl.html" target="image">Figure 6</A>,<A HREF="epiduraltaped.html" target="image">7</A>). Some anesthesiologists recommend suture fixation or subcutaneous tunneling of the catheter to prevent catheter dislodgement when prolonged catheterization is anticipated, although studies have questioned the effectiveness of subcutaneous tunneling.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/bougher.html" target="image">12</A></SUP>  The catheter is taped lateral to the spinous processes without crossing the midline.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR>Following a negative test dose, local anesthetic is administered in incremental doses.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Paramedian Approach</B></FONT><BR>The paramedian approach may offer several advantages over the midline approach to the epidural space. Studies demonstrate that identification of the epidural space on the first attempt is improved and repeat attempts at needle insertion are decreased with the paramedian approach.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/blomberg1.html" target="image">13</A></SUP>  Decreased incidence of failure to thread the catheter, resistance to injection through the catheter, and paresthesia with catheter positioning have also been demonstrated.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/blomberg1.html" target="image">13</A></SUP>  A retrospective study in parturients demonstrated a decreased incidence of intravenous cannulation with the paramedian approach compared with the midline approach.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/jaucot.html" target="image">14</A></SUP>  Rigid epiduroscopy during catheter placement has demonstrated that catheters placed with a paramedian approach take a straight cephalad course more often, and with less tenting of the dura with the tip of the catheter during catheter advancement compared with placement with the midline approach.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/blomberg3.html" target="image">15</A></SUP><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="0"><BR> The paramedian approach may be the only possible approach in patients who are unable to flex the lumbar spine, in patients with severely calcified supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, and when performing epidural anesthesia in the midthoracic region (T5-T9) where the steep angulation of the spinous processes and overlap with the laminae precludes use of the midline approach.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Paramedian Approach: Technique</B></FONT><BR>A mark is made 1.5 cm lateral to the inferior border of the spinous process. After a skin wheal of local anesthetic is made, a 1.5 inch 25 gauge needle is used to infiltrate local anesthetic in the paraspinous muscles in a path directed ventrally and slightly medially. The needle is used to contact and identify lamima. The needle is then withdrawn to the skin, redirected slighly more cephalad, and advanced until either lamina or the superior edge of the lamina is contacted. In this manner the needle is "walked" in fine increments off the superior edge of the lamina. Longer (spinal) needles may be required to identify lamina in patients with generous subcutaneous tissue and paraspinous muscles. Once the superior edge of lamina has been identified, the needle is removed and an 18 gauge Tuohy needle is inserted through the skin and subcutanous tissue with the bevel facing cephalad. The stylet is removed and the needle advanced to contact lamina. The needle is then "walked" off the superior edge of the lamina until ligamentum flavum is contacted. The needle is advanced using the loss of resistance technique.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1 " HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Epidural Anesthesia Following Dural Puncture</B></FONT><BR>A number of concerns are raised when epidural anesthesia is performed following an intentional or unintentional dural puncture.
