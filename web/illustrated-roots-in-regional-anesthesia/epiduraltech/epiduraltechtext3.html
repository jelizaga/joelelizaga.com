Tooshallow placement of the catheter may increase the risk of migration of thecatheter out of the epidural space. In a prospective study that investigatedoptimal catheter insertion length, parturients were randomized to 2, 4, 6,and 8 cm catheter depth in the epidural space.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/dangelo.html" target="image">16</A></SUP>. Intravenous cannulation was morefrequent at 8 cm. Catheters inserted at 2 cm were more likely to becomedislodged, but were associated with significantly fewer cases of unilateralanesthesia. Catheters inserted at 2 or 4 cm required replacement more oftenthan catheters inserted 6 or 8 cm because of more frequent dislodgement.Thus the optimal insertion length probably depends on the anticipated duration of epidural analgesia and perceived risk of catheter dislodgement. Although insertion at 2 cm decreased the incidence of unilateral block, incremental withdrawal of the catheter was successful in providing bilateral block 91% of the time. Intravenously placed catheters, however, were successfully withdrawn only 50% of the time.<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="epiduraltechtext4.html">"DRIP BACK"</A><FONT><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="epiduraltechtext2.html">PREVIOUS</A><FONT><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="../Page1.html" TARGET="_top">HOME</A></FONT></BODY></HTML>
