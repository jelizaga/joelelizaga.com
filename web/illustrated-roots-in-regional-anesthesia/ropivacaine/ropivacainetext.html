Commercialbupivacaine is a 50:50 racemic mixture of the S- and R-enantiomers. Becauseof its greater affinity for and dwell time at voltage-gated sodium channels,the R configuration confers greater cardiotoxicity to racemicbupivacaine.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/mazoit.html" target= "image">1</A></SUP> Compared to the S-enantiomer, R-bupivacaine binds three times more firmlyto the sodium channel, and unbinds 4.4 times as slowly. R-bupivacaineis also more arrhythmogenic, and slows ventricular conduction 4.6 times asmuch as S-bupivacaine.  Ropivacaine is manufactured as the pure S-enantiomerin order to take advantage of the decreased cardiotoxicity of theS-configuration. The decrease in cardiotoxicity due toS-ropivacaine's steroselectivity is the subject of a recentreview.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/dejong.html" target= "image">2</A></SUP><BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="30"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Pharmacokinetic parameters</B></FONT><BR>Ropivacaine is 2-3 times less lipid soluble and has a smaller volume ofdistribution, greater clearance, and shorter elimination half-life thanbupivacaine inhumans.<SUP><A HREF="../medline/lee.html" target = "image">3</A></SUP> The twodrugs have a similar pKa and plasma protein binding (<A HREF="rpharmacokinetics.html" target= "image">Table</A>).<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="10"><BR>Ropivacaine undergoes hepatic biotransformation and renal clearance of the intactdrug accounts for a minor proportion of total clearance.

Ropivacaine is half as potent as bupivacaine in itsdirect negative inotropic effect and slowing of ventricular conduction. Apotential for sudden ventricular arrhythmias still exists with systemic ropivacainetoxicity. Any slight advantage ropivacaine has over bupivacaine maybe eliminated if higher concentrations of ropivacaine are used. Sinceit may provide greater differentiation of sensory and motor block at lowconcentrations and pregnancy does not increase its toxicity, ropivacainemay be a drug well-suited for use in epidural labor analgesia .<BR><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="30"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="ropivacaineframesref.html">REFERENCES</A></FONT><IMG SRC="../tdot.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"><FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="../Page1.html" TARGET="_top">HOME</A></FONT><BR></BODY></HTML>
