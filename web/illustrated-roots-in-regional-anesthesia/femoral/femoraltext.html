The procedure (when combined with sciatic block) is also relatively contraindicated in situations where a dense sensory block could mask the onset of lower extremity compartment syndrome (e.g., fresh fractures of the tibia and fibula, or especially traumatic and extensive elective orthopedic procedures of the tibia and fibula).  This contraindication is not specific for the femoral nerve block but rather applies to regional anesthesia of the lower extremity in general.  The surgeons should be consulted as to the likelihood of the development of compartment syndrome and their own preferences of postoperative analgesic technique when considering the risks and benefits of performing regional anesthesia.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Continuous Femoral Nerve Block:  Indications</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>Postoperative analgesia can be continued for days with a local anesthetic infusion when a catheter is placed within the connective tissue "sheath" of the femoral nerve.

Failure to obtain a opioid-sparing effect in certain knee procedures may be related to lack of blockade in sensory fibers from the sciatic and obturator nerves<A HREF="../medline/hirst.html" target="image"><SUP>17</SUP></A>.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Anatomy</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>The femoral nerve arises from lumbar plexus roots L2-L4 (<A HREF="femoralanatomy.html" TARGET="image">Figure</A>).  The nerve travels through the substance of the psoas muscle, then passes anterior to the iliopsoas under the inguinal ligament before  becoming more superficial in the anterior thigh.  The nerve lies deep to the fascia lata and fascia iliacus (<A HREF="fnfascia.html" TARGET="image">Figure</A>).  The fascia iliacus separates it from the vascular bundle containing the femoral artery and vein.  It divides into numerous branches early in the proximal anterior thigh.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Saphenous Nerve</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>The saphenous nerve is the terminal branch of the femoral nerve.  It passes within the adductor canal beneath the sartorius muscle, then curves around the posteriomedial aspect of the knee to divide into branches along the anteriomedial aspect of the proximal tibia.  This nerve supplies sensation to the medial aspect of the ankle and a variable portion of the medial foot.  Several techniques for blockade of the saphenous nerve have been described.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Planning Neural Blockade</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>When performed preoperatively, the block can be used as the primary anesthetic technique.  When bupivacaine is used, the "soak time" required to develop adequate surgical anesthesia can be considerable.  Planning for early institution of the block for "first cases" of the day, or for performing the block for "to-follow" cases in the pre-operative holding area by a separate anesthesia team while the previous case is still in progress, may help avoid delays in OR turnover.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HSPACE="5" HEIGHT="1">If the primary purpose of the block is to provide postoperative analgesia, performing the block postoperatively rather than preoperatively has the obvious advantage of maximizing the duration of sensory analgesia.  The block can be performed safely under general anesthesia at the end of the case or awake in the PACU following emergence.  It is a common clinical impression that use of larger doses of local anesthetic produce longer-lasting analgesia.  Thus a single injection technique which maximizes the dose of anesthetic may be the technique of choice when the block is performed for postoperative pain relief.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HSPACE="5" HEIGHT="1">Even following injection of large doses of long-acting local anesthetic the block can be expected to dissipate in the middle of the night, unmasking severe pain.  If no provision has been made for "rescue" postoperative analgesia, patients can become extremely dissatisfied with the technique no matter how well the block worked initially.  At our institution, patients who receive peripheral nerve blocks are discharged from the PACU with intravenous opioids via PCA  readily available.  If systemic analgesia with opioids and NSAIDS proves inadequate, the block may be repeated.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Locating the Femoral Nerve</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>A number of techniques for locating the femoral nerve exist.

This technique can be used with the patient under general anesthesia as long as pharmacological neuromuscular blockade has been reversed.  Disadvantages include a requirement for additional equipment and presence of an assistant. <BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">SEEKING PARESTHESIAE</FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>Eliciting paresthesiae provides a definite endpoint for locating the nerve, but requires an awake and responsive patient.

The risk of intravascular injection of a single large volume of local anesthetic is minimized by keeping the needle mobile during injection.  Use of  a constantly moving, small gauge needle may also minimize the risk of neural injury, since one possible cause neural injury is direct intraneural injection of a large volumes of anesthetic.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>"Three-in-One" Block</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>The "three-in-one" block is indicated when anesthesia in the distributions of the obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves as well as the femoral nerve is desired.  This technique relies on a single injection of large volumes of local anesthetic within the neural "sheath" with the needle directed cephalad, and the subsequent spread of anesthetic proximally aided by pressure applied distal to the femoral nerve "sheath", to achieve anesthesia of the entire lumbar plexus.  Dye injection studies in cadavers have cast doubt as to whether local anesthetic spreads to the parent trunk of the obturator nerve<A HREF="../medline/cauhepe.html" target="image"><SUP>20</A>,<A HREF="../medline/ritter.html" target="image">21</SUP></A>.  Clinical studies also have demonstrated that failure to obtain anesthesia in the distribution of lateral femoral cutaneous and obturator nerves is common even with large volumes (40 ml) of local anesthetic<A HREF="../medline/lang.html" target="image"><SUP>22</A>,<A HREF="../medline/seeberger.html" target="image">23</SUP></A>.<BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Local Anesthetic</B></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="tdot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="5"><BR>Typically, 10-15 ml of 0.375-0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 5 µg/ml is used.

Larger volumes of local anesthetic (30 ml or greater) are required to achieve the "three-in-one" block.  Onset of surgical block requires 30-40 minutes.

A 4 inch 22-gauge short-bevel teflon-coated nerve stimulator needle is inserted into a plastic cannula taken from a long 18-gauge intravenous catheter.  The femoral nerve is located using the nerve stimulator as described previously.  A skin nick is made around the needle with a number 15 blade and the plastic cannula is advanced through the skin over the nerve stimulator needle into the "sheath" of the femoral nerve.  The initial dose of local anesthetic can be injected through the cannula to establish the block and facilitate advancement of the catheter.  A 20-gauge (epidural-type) nylon catheter is threaded through the cannula into the femoral "sheath".  The cannula is then removed.  The catheter is sutured into place and dressed sterilely.  Bupivacaine 0.25-0.125% at 0.14 ml/kg/hr is infused.
