		<h2>
			Messing With the Spotify API
		</h2>

		<p>
			This is a front-end I developed in INFO 343 for the Spotify API. Unfortunately, it only
			plays samples, rather than entire songs. I once tried using the YouTube API for 
			something similar (a radio web app) by cutting out the controls and video portion and 
			keeping the sound, but it appears that just about every music video on YouTube has 
			embedding forbidden. Clever, RIAA.
