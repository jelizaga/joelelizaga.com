	EXPLANATION:

		Admittedly, this site, being one the first I've ever built for myself, is exceptionally
		primitive and rough around the edges, but I like keeping it around for the sake of 
		posterity. I think this portfolio played a major part in my acceptance into the University
		of Washington's iSchool, in spite of blatantly poor prerequisite grades.

		These were my grades in the Informatics prerequisite classes:
		CSE 142 - 2.2, 2.7
		STAT 221 - 2.9
		INFO 200 - 3.4

		Besides this comment, everything in the proceeding lines is precisely as it was in
		Spring 2015.

	No frameworks, no Dreamweaver, no Bootstrap. I like a handbuilt approach. 
	You might notice that all of my projects have an element of human error: the lines on the
	watercolors feather into the paper and are nowhere near straight, all my presentation slides
	are done in an image editor so as to be personally arranged and timed without Powerpoint 
	formatting, my movies are cut in an application with a steep learning curve and a high ceiling
	(FCP7), I have an easily identifiable writing voice. If I make a graph in Numbers I'll trace 
	the illustration in Sketchbook so it looks less like everybody else's, and all of my computers
	are hilariously precarious projects.

	Arguably, this lack of templates, mechanicism, and taking advantage of the available
	efficiency-boosting softwares makes me an inefficient applicant in comparison to other
	candidates. On the other hand, I know it's a leaning that makes me stick out. It's an
	approach that I respect in other people, and those I look up to; organicism and display of
	personal ingenuity and effort. Whenever I read Osamu Tezuka's comics I can always point
	out accidental pencil markings and variations of line-width in the panels. I like that. I'd
	take Francisco Goya over the brutal reproduceability of flat design any day.

	There's an obvious tradeoff; the break-neck technological evolution demonstrated by Moore's
	Law makes this approach obsolete by the minute. Our species is racing to bury human error
	beneath the gloss of technology.
	But you'd rather have a hand-made birthday card than something from Hallmark, right?

	Thanks for reading.

						I. Introduction
					</h1>
					<p>
						Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've included a collection of recent (since 2013) projects: some are academic,
						some are completely extracurricular and personal. In essence, I'd like to
						use these projects to demonstrate to you that I have the patience,
						technical expertise, and intrinsic motivation with which to to sustain the 
						development of large projects and see them to completion. I think that
						these projects best represent my current capabilities as well as my
						interests; both traits that may be cultivated in the iSchool and used to
						succeed in the institution.

						II. Some Films
					</h1>
					<p>
						Below, I've collected some notable, recent movie projects that I've both edited
						and directed. The matter of management of persons, time, resources,
						and technology are all important (and demostrated below), but I'd like to
						divert your attention to something I find more pertinent to informatics:
						the ability to present information. When making a movie in any capacity,
						as a director, editor, actor, prop-guy, guy-with-the-microphone, or
						provider-of-cast-appeasing-lunches, one's primary task is the handling
						and depicting of information. Acting as director and editor in the
						compositions below, it has been my responsibility to present a final cut that
						conveys the story and message of the projects in a way that's compelling
						to the eyes and ears. I see media as a matter of instilling a 
						<em>desire</em> to experience and absorb information in one's audience. If
						movie cuts are too fast, if the sound fluctuates too violently and 
						doesn't match the tone, if it's as flat and boring and as warm de-carbonated
						cola, if the colors are as washed out as old denim, it's not finished; the
						information will not be properly communicated. I know that information 
						must possess some element of clarity, readability, and purpose: this is 
						an aptitude I bring to the field of informatics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rather than focus on media as a career, I'd like to blend my past-time with
						something useful; something applicable, like information science. The truth is,
						cheap, if not free, media is on tap: it's very easy to end up endlessly
						browsing YouTube or Netflix or perpetually playing video games. In the
						21st century, your entertainment is only limited by how much dopamine you
						can crank out of your head. So, while I enjoy studying and producing media,
						I'd like to do something with more potential for positive impact (like
						informatics), with my efforts propelled by my technical skill.

					</p>
					<p>
						Essentially, we were split into groups and given a battle from ancient
						history, then told to produce a twenty-minute movie about it. 
						My group was given <a 
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon">the Battle of
						Marathon.</a> The group appointed me director and editor, as I had 
						previous experience working on experimental media at Evergreen as well as
						working on personal movie projects, and I really, really enjoy
						post-production. I like post for the same reason I like programming: armed 
						with any amount of creativity, one has the ability to take virtually 
						nothing and construct a nigh-infinity of digital realities.

						I picked up some public domain movies from archive.org to interpolate

						We used Golden Gardens to film our battle scenes; Marathon was located near
						the shores of Greece. Allegedly, the Persians were ran into the sea. This
						presented some challenges: for one, we had to contend with beach-goers
						for screentime, and two, it made sound near-impossible due to the deafening
						winds of the unprotected beach. I snapped lavaliers on the lapels of the 
						cast and had them face away from the wind when talking, then washed the 
						dialogue in Logic. We recorded some of the narration in the halls of 
						the aerospace department. Hey, it was quiet.

						thrice in the final battle scenes. I fell ill on our final shoot,

						Third Parent <em>(Winter 2014)</em>
					</h2>
					<br />

					<br />
					<p>
						<em>Third Parent</em> was produced for a "self-representation" project assigned by
						an experimental media class I took at Evergreen. Thus far, I've finished half
						of the film. The completed half is a survey of the role information
						technology and video games played in my childhood, and how my parents'
						exposure to technology and <em>their</em> parent's exposure to technology
						had an impact on my own relationship to technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second half is to act as an antithesis to the first half. Throughout
						the first half (what I've embedded above) there's whimsical music,
						colorful visuals, and smiles all around as my parents reflect on their
						formative years with 1980's information technology and <em>Space Invaders.</em>
						Despite the cheery tone, there are ominous hints of insidiousness that
						are casually waved away. The second half is intended to make due on these
						hints, the thesis being that with the endless convenience and entertainment
						yielded by technological evolution, there are tradeoffs. In essence, a
						significant portion of my generation was raised with a "third parent," and
						that it's up to us to use this experience to determine how the ubiquity of
						technology will affect our children, and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						The class asked for an 8-minute video: I completed and screened 8 minutes,
						then continued working on the film after the quarter had ended.

						I drew the pixel-animations, <em>frame by frame,</em> in Pixen at a 
						multiple of 1080px, then transferred each frame to Pixelmator and blew
						them up to 1080px, thus producing the 8-bit effect. While time-consuming,
						I'm pleased with the results.

						There were only two videos on the A-roll: the interview with my father, and
						the interview with my mother. This was by design. With so little "real
						life" footage, I could fill the other half of screen time with the B-roll
						of animation and mixed-video collage. The sparse material also compelled
						me to spend a significant effort designing sound. The audio in <em>Third
						Parent</em> is equally as complex as the video.

						If there's one project that may have shaved a few months off of my
						projected longevity, it's this one. This stop motion project was
						done by my friend, Wade, and me, for the same experimental media class
						I mentioned while discussing <em>Third Parent</em>. It doesn't look like it, as
						the movie's dead silent for the duration of three minutes, but both of us would
						stay up until four in the morning painting kites and the set. I would
						drive home to Tacoma from Olympia, get two hours of sleep, and one hour
						later, we'd be back in the animation studio. Wade wrote the subtitles,
						I edited the movie, and we both broke our backs over the animation
						table. The problem was that we shot the animation at 24 frames per
						second. Most groups worked at 10 or 15 frames per second, but we wanted
						something smoother. There's a version with sound, but it died when my
						laptop was bricked in a tragic tea-spilling accident. I'm much more
						dogmatic about keeping back-ups now.

					<span class="caption">
						We wanted a red title. At the time, we only had pink-tinted watercolor
						pens on hand. We used them anyhow, and I corrected the difference in post,
						colorizing the pink to look more saturated, dark, and red. The story is

						The kites were built from watercolor paper. We strung them with yarn so
						as to get the two-dimensional "physics" right. Pictured above is ten
						kites. Note that, for every single frame, we had to incrementally move
						each puppet and take a shot. For pans, the animation table would have to
						be precisely, consistently manuevered, frame-by-frame. I created the
						backdrop of the animation; it's one very large set with various locations
						we used to stage the movie.

						III. A Book
					</h1>
					<p>
						My generation was raised on hip hop; I remember running circuits in my
						middle school gymniasium while the laminated wood-panel floors
						reverberated with the guttural bass of whatever the latest Kanye West
						or Chris Brown song was. Since I've started college I've been building 
						olympic-size playlists focused on various themes, locations, groups,
						and tropes in the genre, and hawking them off to my friends via USB
						or zip.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm no scholar, but I know enough to have written a 34-page cursory
						survey of American hip hop for my younger sister's 17th birthday,
						called <em>Joel Elizaga's U.S. Hip Hop History Libretto.</em> 
						My sister and I share this semi-encyclopedic fandom, and I've taken up
						the duty of making sure she's always able to outwit and out-know the
						hip hop-heads at her prep school. It was a fitting present.
						I included
						a USB stick with all of the music cataloged in the book all properly
						arranged by XML and stripped of original album art (and replaced with 
						custom art). 
						<a href="files/libretto.pdf">Here's the pdf.</a> This whole project
						was a matter of organizing information: history, music, imagery and
						text. I consider the book that I gave my sister an alpha version; there's
						no APA citations and all of the pictures are clearly pulled off of
						Google Images, and I've noticed quite a few mispellings after the
						print. I'd like to do a reproduction with a different, more professional-
						looking format than the one I cut together in Pages. Since the playlists 
						included in the book are constantly expanding and updating, I plan on
						producing a second, more refined and much larger version in the future.
					</p>
					<p>
						The book was shipped to me in a clean plastic sheet. It's exciting, seeing
						a digital creation made tangible. I thought to myself, <em>Hey, I might
						actually be able to do this for a living.</em>

						IV. A Hackintosh

					<p>
						I was raised in a family of Mac loyalists. If memory serves, my dad's still
						got the multicolored-rainbow-Apple stickers from the 1990's that came with
						his PowerMac.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, I wasn't an Apple cultist. All of my nerdy friends ran Windows; they
						could play all the cool games, they never had any horrific compatability
						issues with ports, they could run .exes, and their computers were
						upgradeable and seemingly faster. Once Apple started pumping out the
						"Hi, I'm a Mac!" ads, a young Joel Elizaga was mortified by the sudden
						trendiness of his Saab-level techno-enclave.
					</p>
					<p>
						I vowed to slap together a Windows-machine the second I could. <em>I'll
						show them,</em> I thought, <em>Now nobody will confuse me with the
						technologically illiterate and blissfully artsy!</em>

						And then Windows 8 was released with the neon duplo tiles.

						V. An INFO 200 Poster
					</h1>
					<p>
						I took INFO 200 over Winter 2015; our group devised a hypothetical 
						mobile application intended to allow users to avoid long lines on the
						Ave, called <em>Ave No Wait.</em> We designed preliminary posters, but
						the final design was hiked to me, because the others weren't too confident
						in their aptitude for design. Also, I was eager to make something, and
						hadn't touched watercolors since 2014. I had the group send me their
						text and designs, printed said texts out, and made a cohesive design that
						reflected their's, then painted the poster on some watercolor board I
						picked up at the Husky book store on the Ave.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm taking my mandatory composition credit over Spring 2015, but if you're
						looking for some authentication as to my ability to compose text, I wrote
						both the <a href="files/info-problem.pdf">information problem 
						(project introduction)</a> and

						<h4>
							INFO 200 Reflection Paper: Hot Air & High Fives
						</h4>

						<h3>
							<em>User-Centered Design:</em> Who are the users?
						</h3>
						<p>
							Prior to taking INFO 200, I had been printing articles on some seemingly
							dubious practices in the technology industry and keeping them in a large 
							black binder. Around 2014 and the release of the Snowden revelations I 
							became paranoid of

							<a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/">backdoors,</a>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/us/politics/edward-snowden-at-nsa-sexually-explicit-photos-often-shared.html?_r=0">personal data-mining,</a> <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">the power of scientific social engineering and marketing,</a> <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/14/business/la-fi-mh-net-neutrality-20140114">Comcast,</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">tethering,</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750">the psychological tradeoffs of spending one's life in front of a screen,</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/23/225381596/booting-up-new-nsa-data-farm-takes-root-in-utah">and government surveillance.</a> To me, it had appeared that the horribly anarchic digital playground of my childhood was
							congealing into an insurmountable black box of omniscient technological 
							deities endowed with the forces of big data. I began substantially 
							cutting back on my digital footprint, wiped all of my social media, and
							tried my best to become some kind of ghost. I ended up with less web 
							presence than both of my middle-aged parents and my little sister. 
							At some point, I figuratively threw up my hands, thinking, "Man, this
							technology sucks, and I can't click a thing without feeling marginally
							exploited. <em>Doesn't anybody give a damn about the users anymore?</em> 
							I feel Google's colorfully corrosive and rancid breath down my spine at
							every turn. I can't escape."
						</p>
						<p>
							Then I took INFO 200, learned about 
							<a href="http://vsdesign.org/">Batya Friedman's Value-Sensitive Design theory,</a> and
							was relieved to find that people contemplate the values of users 
							sometimes. I was a little incredulous that VSD was even a concept.
							I took this class, and I'm aiming for Informatics, and I'm studying
							programming, all so that I can have some say and participatory
							presence in the direction of technology and information science.
							I want to be able to make software and systems that respect the users
							and aren't harmful at the very least, and is helpful and enriching at
							the very best. Essentially, I was looking for some perspective similar
							to VSD. Then again, who are the users? Are the users shareholders and
							programmers, or are the users consumers? These two camps often have
							conflicting values and desires at odds with each other.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<em>The Social Side of Technology:</em> Is it worth it?
						</h3>
						<p>
							Admittedly, I'm cynical. If the human species truly valued privacy as
							much as we so loudly purport, 
							<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/upshot/americans-say-they-want-privacy-but-act-as-if-they-dont.html?abt=0002&abg=0">I don't think Mark Zuckerberg would be as
							wealthy a man as he is.</a> Who's to say that privacy is a virtue or
							that humans shouldn't yield self-control to Google's brilliant,
							top-secret marketing algorithms? Are the values that we readily claim
							to uphold in practices such as VSD true human values, if they're not so
							pervasively respected or aspired to? If our species would like to trade
							their digital privacy for digital friendships and endless
							entertainment, who's to say that it's wrong? What is wrong?
							Can wrong be measured?
						</p>
						<h3>
							<em>Legal & Ethical Issues:</em> Is it empty rhetoric?
						</h3>
						<p>
							Ethically, I think that the true takeaway of INFO 200 and the past few
							years since the
							<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">PRISM break</a> is
							that information is a manifestation of power--it is power--<em>scientia
							potentia est.</em> We discussed gender, cultural, and ability
							perspectives, values, the behavior of information, the capability of
							information to both do harm and aid others: the capability of 
							information to save, heal, manipulate, deceive, exploit, monetize,
							convenience, satiate, and starve. What I understood was, "Information
							is more powerful and alluring than spices, salt, oil, and gold. Some
							people have lots, some people have less, some people have none; it's
							stored in our bodies and our external devices, and its trade and
							distribution has an enormous impact across our species, from corporate
							espionage to basic literacy." When the collection, sharing, denying,
							twisting, and selling of information effects even the most inane
							details around us, it becomes the human's duty to wield it ethically,
							or, at least, for the benefit of the species. Whenever iTunes
							forcefully updates and gets subjectively hilariously worse and
							invasive, and I switch browsers and can't use Adblock to hide from
							YouTube's obnoxious commercials, I wonder, though, "Are we, as a
							species, really going to wield it ethically, or is this just hot air
							and high fives?"
