			Automated &amp; De-Sensationalized News
		</h2>
		<p>
			The News v2.0 is a semi-functioning prototype news website I developed for a major 
			quarter-long <i>INFO 360 (Design Thinking)</i> group project. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In concept, The News v2.0 is a news outlet with de-sensationalized and uninflammatory 
			articles algorithmically written by a contingent of bots and web-crawlers. These bots 
			and crawlers aggregate content across the web's numerous news sites and blogs, and use 
			the collected data to compose concise news articles with indisputible facts, free of 
			adjectives and appeals to emotion of any sort, allowing the audience to formulate their 
			own reactions, interpretations and opinions without the visceral, click-bait and 
			profit-driven headlines and content commonly seen in contemporary yellow journalism. 
			This concept, in theory, is meant to minimize the proliferation of disinformation and 
			stress caused by everyday exposure to newsworthy events, both of which have an adverse 
			impact on one's physical well-being, as determined by the research we performed over the
			duration of this project. The news-by-automation concept was inspired by the use of bots
			by the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/17/quakebot_los_angeles_times_robot_journalist_writes_article_on_la_earthquake.html">
			<i>Los Angeles Times,</i></a>
			<a href="http://www.poynter.org/2014/ap-will-use-robots-to-write-some-business-stories/257245/">
			<i>Associated Press,</i></a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/narrativescience/#1c779c9b1f07">
			<i>Forbes</i></a> write news articles. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The sample articles of The News v2.0 were written by my group members, Tyler Bauer and
			Christopher Maglio, while I built the website itself. Following the themes of 
			approachability and simplicity in news content, I gave the site an easily navigatable 
			minimalist aesthetic with the intention of enhancing the timely and stress-free 
			consumption of news. I'm proud of how it turned  out and I'm looking forward to 
			improving my web development and design skills.
