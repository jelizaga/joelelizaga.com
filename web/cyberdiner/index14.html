Valencia<P>What all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't do, Dr. JaimeLaico, the country's foremost exponent of plastic surgery, does. A pioneerin the field of plastic surgery, Dr. Laico's many and successful work inthe field have made him the refuge that the physically handicapped men, womenand children seek. He helps them face the world with utmost confidence andwithout the slightest feeling of inferiority complex by correcting theirphysical defects. There's no denying that a physically defective man, womanor child shuns company and feels inferior to a normal person. With the helpof plastic surgery they are given that incentive to live and to lead a normallife.<P>Slightly baldish, sturdily built, standing 5' 6" tall and in his late forties,Dr. Laico is a man with a ready grin and steady blue-black eyes, a man whothrough sheer effort and honest toil and endeavor has become what he is today.Happily married to Luz Banos, of Legaspi, Albay, the amiable doctor and hiswife have been blessed with ten children. To him, life is one big bookfulof problems which have to be solved - as they come.<P>One of the seven children of the late couple, Congressman Ananias Laico andRosario Evidente, Dr. Laico was born in the little town of Magdalena, Laguna.He received his elementary schooling at the Magdalena Elementary School.After finishing at the U.P. High School he took up medicine at the U.P. Collegeof Medicine, graduating in 1930. Right after graduation, he became a residentphysician at the Philippine General Hospital and remained thus for five years.In 1936 he was appointed medical director of the Albay Provincial Hospital.The year 1937 saw him going back to the PGH but this time as a non-residentconsulting surgeon. At the same time he was appointed medical director ofthe infirmary of the U.P. College of Agriculture, Los Banos, Laguna, a posthe held till 1944. After Liberation, he severed his connections with theLos Banos Infirmary and devoted his full time at the PGH as one of its consultingsurgeons, a post he holds to the present. In 1948 he was appointed assistantprofessor of general surgery at the U.P. College of Medicine. Dr. Laico isa member of the board of regents of the Philippine College of Surgeons, anexclusive organization composed of surgeons of the country.<P>His mornings are devoted to holding consultations and performing operationsat the PGH, while in the afternoons one finds him teaching general and plasticsurgery at the College of Medicine, U.P. Among many applicants, in November1949, he was chosen by a special board of judges, to specialize in plasticsurgery under the best plastic surgeons of the United States, England andItaly. This was sponsored by the UNICEF under the auspices of the World HealthOrganization.<P>His interest in plastic surgery was first aroused in 1937 when he treateda woman patient who had suffered severe burns at the neck. When her burnshealed, her neck contracted and she looked like a neckless person. "I madeup my mind to do something for the poor girl. She became an incentive tomy taking interest in plastic surgery. But, believe it or not, she hasn'tbeen operated on till now; she hasn't enjoyed the fruits of the studies Iundertook for her sake," mused the doctor.<P>Asked the reason behind that twist of fate, Dr. Laico said: "In plastic surgeryoperations, specially in major ones like hers, the process takes about ayear or more to perform as a series of operations are involved. Being a verybusy woman, she couldn't find time to submit to the operation, though shehas promised to do so in the very near future."<P>The very first case of plastic operation performed by Dr. Laico was the tube-flapsurgery. <A HREF="index18.html">The case</A> involved a boy at the charityward of the PGH who had developed a gangrenous cheek as an aftermath of measles.Seeing the cheek slowly disintegrating, with nobody daring to do somethingabout it, Dr. Laico decided there and then to operate on the boy. Ransackingthe PGH library for literature on plastic surgery and relying on the journalshe had been receiving from abroad, the doctor started the laborious tube-flapsurgery to repair the gangrenous cheek of the boy late in 1940, successfullyending the series of operations in 1942. "It took me one and a half yearsto finish the job, and then too, there were the many difficulties I had toencounter: firstly, there were no anti-biotics then to prevent infectionof the wound; secondly, the boy being a charity case, we did not have commandof the operating room as there were many scheduled operations for pay cases,"related Dr. Laico.<P>Another case of his and the first of its kind to be done here was that ofa man without a thumb. In this particular case, Dr. Laico converted theforefinger to do the chores of the thumb via plastic surgery, thus enablingthe man to grasp and hold things like a normal person. Long before our sociallyprominent and wealthy people began to go abroad for plastic surgery operationssuch as nose lifting, Palpebral fold construction i.e., eyes-fixing,sand-papering treatment of the skin, etc., Dr. Laico had been doing all theseand many other phases of plastic surgery.<P>Hunging all around his office, which is situated off Ward 8 on the 2nd floorof the PGH, are framed pictures of his many works, depicting the "before"and the "after" stages of his operations, mute evidence of his untiring effortfor the betterment of the physically defective.<P>Speaking of the advancement of plastic surgery in the Philippines. Dr. Laicobelieves that whatever can be done abroad can be done here too because ofthe steady flow of journals on the latest development of plastic surgeryabroad.<P>"Today, people are getting to be more plastic surgery-conscious; indeed onecan say that the development of plastic surgery here goes hand in hand withprogress abroad."<P><A HREF="index13.html"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="JaimeLaicoIcon" WIDTH="54"    HEIGHT="74"></A></BODY></HTML>
