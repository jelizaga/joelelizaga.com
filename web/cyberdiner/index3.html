&nbsp;I mean, they're still valuable and everything,but I didn't want the whole cottage composed of someone ELse's soul...andthat's a little how it felt. &nbsp;I'd originally chosen the "mainly link"format because I wasn't in a space to write a dissertation about myself thatliterally the entire world could access. &nbsp;Now that I'm in a more openplace, I think I'm ready to do some writing.<P>Okay, just to get over the basics (or what you might consider the basics),I am twenty-nine years old at this writing. &nbsp;A Pisces, Aquarius cuspwith Scorpio rising and a Sagittarius moon. &nbsp;A classic INFJ and a 4with a 5 wing on the enneagram. &nbsp;I am a married, stay-home mom of oneson, Joel, who is three, and I'm pregnant and due around Thanksgiving. &nbsp;Iwas raised Roman Catholic although I wouldn't call myself practicing. &nbsp;Infact, it's confusing to me in general, because I *am Catholic like I *ama woman, mother, etcetera. &nbsp;I mean, it's in the fiber of myself butI don't "believe" in it. &nbsp;Is that too confusing? &nbsp;It doesn't feelthat way. &nbsp;It's a part of who I AM, not something that I BELIEVE.&nbsp;Actually, I don't know *what I believe these days, which I don't thinkis really such a bad thing. &nbsp;I haven't stopped searching for it, soit's not as if I've given up or anything. &nbsp;I just don't know what itis yet. &nbsp;<P><P>Hm.<P><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P>Something that defines me: &nbsp;I am a mom. &nbsp;And maybe it doesn't seemforward thinking to say that this defines me, but it does and I don't seethat it's at all backwards. &nbsp;Joel is the light of my life, the "sweetestpea in my garden", and there is nothing on earth as affirming as watchinga soul grow and having some input into its blossoming. &nbsp;This child isa miracle and a wonder to me, and small Phoebe inside is just as spectaculara mystery as her big brother Joel. &nbsp;I can't wait to meet her! &nbsp;I'mgetting impatient...and yet the small kicks and rolls are such a smilingsecret and I will miss them awfully when she does come to meet us.<P><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P>Something else: &nbsp;I ask lots of questions. &nbsp;Of those I love, ofmyself, of the universe in general. &nbsp;I recently bought a car and wantto personalize it somehow, quietly. &nbsp;My latest idea is to buy a licenseplate holder that says, "Question". &nbsp;Andrew says that noone will GETit, but I answer, Hey, do I *care who GETS it? &nbsp;It's for ME, and mykindreds will get it! &nbsp;<P>You know, I just realized that it sounds like I may be a loud person.&nbsp;Really, I'm not. &nbsp;Maybe - probably - it's more accurate to saythat I *think questions, rather than *ask them. &nbsp;<P>Anyway. &nbsp;<P>Where was I?&nbsp;<P>Oh yeah - the questions. &nbsp;I've been asking them forever, I think.&nbsp;However long "forever" is. &nbsp;It's the way I communicate: &nbsp;Listenand Ask. &nbsp;I have a great desire to Know, and at times it's frustratingbecause there's so much I'll just not learn. &nbsp;But you know, learningAbout is the huge draw for me, soaking up everything possible about whateverit is that interests me or whomever I'm with...&nbsp;&nbsp;<P><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Center><IMG SRC="violetplacecard.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="72"><P ALIGN=Center>Kate.<P ALIGN=Center><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left>All right. &nbsp;WELL. &nbsp;I think it's time for the links, don't you?<P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left>I guess that writing where I surf tells something about me, doesn't it?&nbsp;Well then, truthfully, most of my online time &nbsp;(and there's notas much of it as SOME people think!) is spent only a few ways. &nbsp;<P ALIGN=Left>I spend time looking for just the right<I><A HREF="http://www.cardcentral.net">postcard</A></I> to send to a dearone in cyberspace...<P ALIGN=Left>I also have an obsession about everything to do with the<I><A HREF="http://www.california.com/~rpcman/LDS.HTM#top">LDS Church</A></I>&nbsp;for some reason, who knows why...(and rest assured I have no intentionof converting or anything remotely like that; the whole organization justFAScinates the pants off me!)<P ALIGN=Left>Sometimes I like to know <A HREF="#practical"><I>practical stuff</I></A>...<P ALIGN=Left>And then of course, I<I><A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com">surf</A></I> &nbsp;for everythingelse!<P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left><A NAME="practical">THE PRACTICAL STUFF</A>:<P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.cnn.com">News</A><P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.weather.com">Weather</A><P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.cyberspace.com/bobk/home.html">Local stuff</A><P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/current">The ferry schedule</A><P ALIGN=Left><FONT COLOR="White">.</FONT><P ALIGN=Left>IMPORTANT STUFF -- (not asPractical...I <I>guess</I>...)<P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">Books!</A><P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/frontdoor/">Hotwired</A><P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www.cyan.com">Cyan</A> <P ALIGN=Left><A HREF="http://www1.riven.com">Riven</A><P ALIGN=Left></BODY></HTML>
