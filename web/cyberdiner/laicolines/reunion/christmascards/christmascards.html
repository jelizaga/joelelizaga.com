Everyone came at 1 PM and later because         <i>mga ina-antok pa.</i> Eddie was absent because he had asthma and Bambi         was on duty. Peewee prepared pancit molo, roast turkey with all the trimmings,         rellenong alimasag, fresh lumpia, lasagna, a shrimp salad, fruit salad         and cakes.

There were celebrations in different         centers of Manila. We decided to go to the <a href="#newyears" onClick="NewWindow3()">Ayala         Center street party</a> where a huge stage was set up for programs featuring         the big name entertainers. We were in the area of the Peninsula hotel         and as early as 5 PM bands were playing and people started coming in.         By 7:30 PM the crown was so thick. We had a very good view of the stage         and the giant screen. The program was so entertaining and fireworks were         set off every 15 minutes. At 20 minutes before midnight, people were all         getting so excited, standing on the chairs, making a lot of noise. Finally         at midnight, the fireworks display started and went on for 15 minutes.         <i>Ang ganda! </i></p>      <p> Lunch was here at home and everyone started coming past 1 PM because         of the New Year's Eve celebrations. We had a singing contest and a "name         that tune" contest after the New Year's Day lunch. <i>Ang dami palang         disintonado sa pamilya!</i> All the adults including BJ and Jeremy shelled         out P50. each which we pooled together and divided for the 1st and 2nd         prizes. <i>EVERYONE HAD TO SING.</i> Maryanne Laico kept hiding and when         it was her turn, she sang a few lines and gave up. She got P500. from         her purse and said, <i>"Magbabayad na lang ako para hindi kumanta.&quot;         </i>(I'll just pay P500 -- just don't let me sing!) </p>      <p>Everyone was shy about singing. They sang from where they were seated.         <a href="#newyears" onClick="NewWindow4()">Mariel</a> was the comic relief.         When it was her turn, she went to the front and sang "The Greatest Love         of All" with a very heavy Visayan accent, with action and with <i>pakaway-kaway         pa,</i> really <i>baduy</i>. She had everyone laughing. She should have         been in the Laico reunion. </p>    </td>    <td width="71" height="265">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="91" height="135" rowspan="5"><img src="../tdot.gif" width="1" height="1"><img src="../tdot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="45"></td>    <td width="498" height="135" rowspan="5">       <p><a name="pictures"></a>&nbsp;</p>      <p><b>PICTURES</b></p>      <p><a href="#pictures" onClick="NewWindow1()">The Villanuevas. </a></p>      <p><a href="#pictures" onClick="NewWindow7()">Peewee and Edwin on New Year's Eve.</a></p>      <p><a href="#pictures" onClick="NewWindow6()">Laicos toast the New Year.</a>       </p>      <p><a href="#pictures" onClick="NewWindow5()">Paul David</a> hams it up.</p>      <p><a href="#pictures" onClick="NewWindow2()">Maria and Anton Santayana with         Baby Samantha.</a></p>    </td>    <td width="71" height="135" rowspan="5">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td height="22" width="91">&nbsp;</td>    <td height="22" width="498">       <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font size="-1"><a href="../contents.html">HOME</a></font></p>    </td>    <td height="22" width="71">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="91" height="52">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="498" height="52"><a href="../malia/malia.html"><img src="../backlight.gif" width="72" height="72" align="right" alt="Back" border="0"></a></td>    <td width="71" height="52">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
