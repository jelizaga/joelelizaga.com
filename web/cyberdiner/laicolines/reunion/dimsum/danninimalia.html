The poor clerk   had even been told to partially disrobe. No wonder, when I tried to take a shortcut   through the lobby after hot-tubbing, there were several policemen there, and   I was told to go around the side so as not to disturb the fingerprints in the   front doors. I would still highly recommend that hotel -- the Marriot Residence   Inn of Pleasant -- it's great! </p></body></html>
