Somehow it reminded me of gladiator combat in ancient         Roman times, in which the contestants who were selected to compete didn't         have a choice in the matter, let alone choose their opponent. Comparatively,         it was against contest rules for the singer to be able to choose the song,         and too bad if it wasn't in your key. I don't know if this is what karaoke         is like at other places, but I guess it's all part of the fun. </p>      <p><a name="rick"></a>Alfie was the first contestant, singing "Celebration",         bringing forth wild cheers from his womenfolk, Helena and Nonon. Next         was Grace, singing "Unforgettable". Irresistible, thought husband Arthur,         who couldn't keep from planting a kiss on her cheek in midsong. Then,         <a href="#rick" onClick="NewWindow2()">Ricky Martin</a> (Elizaga), veteran         karaoke go-er, but unlikely performer, surprised and delighted the crowd         with an go-all-out performance of "Twist and Shout", even dancing a <a href="#rick" onClick="NewWindow6()">charming         twist</a> for effect. By this time Jovits and Rory could no longer keep         from recruiting themselves as background dancers.</p>      <p><a name="paolo"></a>The other Ric, as in Ricardo, sauntered on next,         singing "California Girls", to a now wildly cheering crowd. California         girlfriend Melissa seemed to heartily approve. I hope Popoy's neighbors         will still let him live there-it must have sounded like a stadium. Singing         "YMCA" was <a href="#paolo" onClick="NewWindow1()">Paolo</a>, who was         surprised to find he instantly had a full row of background dancers supporting         him, due to arm motions which the song required. Even though he found         out later that he wouldn't have been qualified to be in the running for         the prize since his parents were donating it, he still deserves a congrats         for the best physical coordination-- spelling, holding a microphone, and         singing, all at the same time. Little Kathleen Dizon, bobbing and clapping         her hands deserves a prize for Cutest Background Dancer (sorry, Via!).</p>      <p><a name="jovits"></a>That was a tough act for <a href="#jovits" onClick="NewWindow3()">Jovits</a>         to follow, singing "That's What Friends Are For", but she held her own,         abruptly breaking character at the end when she demanded,<a href="#jovits" onClick="NewWindow5()">"Will         you still respect me?"</a> The crowd was still hungry for more, and the         next victim was Boggie, singing "La Bamba", after trying to abscond by         arguing, "I don't speak espaniole." Popoy "The Pretender", was then pressured         to the stage by special request from the crowd. And what a show he delivered!         See what happens when you peel off all the clinging kids! </p>      <p><a name="CDplayer"></a>Shy-no-more Jovim gets a special mention for his         excellent performance of "I Saw Her Standing There". And Malu proved she         hasn't lost her touch. She really worked the crowd, singing "I'll Never         Fall in Love". After judges Mike, Tito Jun and Sondra conferred, the grand         winner of a<a href="#CDplayer" onClick="NewWindow4()"> 5-disc CD player</a>         donated by Mitos and Randy, was Ricky Martin (Elizaga), falling on the         floor in astonishment. Thanks to all the singers, a good time was had         by all in the true Laico tradition.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><b>DISAPPOINTED</b>: <a href="#CDplayer" onClick="NewWindow7()">Rory</a> wanted to be called to         sing for the karaoke contest. But not being a contestant didn't stop her         from giving her all singing old songs at New Year's Eve.</p>    </td>    <td width="19%" height="540">       <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="18%" height="51">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="63%" height="51">       <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><a href="contestants.html"><font size="-1">LIST OF THE CONTESTANTS</font></a></p>      <p><font size="-1"><a href="../contents.html">HOME</a></font></p>    </td>    <td width="19%" height="51">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="18%" height="30">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="63%" height="30"><a href="../polvoron/polvoron.html"><img src="../backlight.gif" width="72" height="72" align="right" alt="Back" border="0"></a></td>    <td width="19%" height="30"><a href="contestants.html"><img src="../nextlight.gif" width="72" height="72" align="left" alt="Next" border="0"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
