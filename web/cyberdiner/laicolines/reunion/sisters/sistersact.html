A sexy <a href="#text" onClick="NewWindow1()">hot-pink         boa</a> was very effectively used as a prop. Every one of the sisters         grinned unabashedly as she effortlessly performed the moves with Laico         trademark grace and charm. Everyone had to laugh at the lyrics, so appropriate,         but ended comically with:</p>      <blockquote>         <p> <i>Lord help the mister</i></p>        <p><i>who comes between me and my sister</i></p>        <p><i>And Lord help the sister</i></p>        <p><i>who comes between me and my man!</i></p>      </blockquote>      <p> I later asked Nini how she came up with the song, it seemed to fit so         well. She said, "Oh, Ching and I used to sing that all the time, and something         just recently reminded me of it. The only thing was, I couldn't remember         the title or where it came from, and I asked in all the music shops and         couldn't seem to find it. Then I mentioned it to an old friend of mine         and she said, 'Oh, it's in Bing Crosby's <i>White Christmas!'</i> Well,         you know how hard it is to find anything in Morton, but there it was in         the video rentals." </p>      <p>And the rest is (Laico) history. </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>    <td width="20%" height="328">       <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="15%" height="324">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="65%" height="324">       <p><img src="sister3.jpg" width="432" height="309" alt="Sisters Act"></p>      <font size="-1">After the Sister Act number the audience yelled, &quot;More,       more!&quot; After they actually repeated the dance, Salman yelled, &quot;No       more!
