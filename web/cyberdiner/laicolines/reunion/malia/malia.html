I will, like, remember         everybody I met and all the fun things we did, especially, like: getting         a prize for being on the <a href="../letsbowl/letsbowl.html" target="_blank">winning         team</a> in bowling; getting a beautiful green parrot from a total stranger         at the bowling alley; swimming and hot-tubbing at the Marriott Residence         Inn with Isa, Eamon, Aunt Cristina, Rahim and Karim; riding backwards         on the BART and looking down at the cars on the highway below us; the         human statues and huge Christmas tree and live band on Union Square; the         castles made of candy and the chandeliers in the St. Francis Hotel (named         after my Dad); &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in the Metreon; the         hundreds of candles inside paper bags along the paths to the church; but         most of all the presents on Christmas Day and Uncle Ricky in the <a href="../karaoke/karaoke.html" target="_blank">karaoke</a>.       </p>      <p>I was, like, nervous during the pageant that we had. I thought I might         not read that good, but it was OK. Rahim had, like, this cape with lots         of gold in it --made him look like, really a king. The <a href="../dimsum/dimsum.html" target="_blank">dimsum         thing</a> was good; we had, like, a whole upstairs of a restaurant to         ourselves. Chinatown was neat. I got a ring with my birthstone, magnetic         earrings and a tea set for my mom there. Eamon, Isa and I also played         in the playground there, and then again in the humongous slides at the         Metreon playground after going to &quot;The Way Things Work&quot; which         was just so much fun -- a 3-D Mammoth spraying water at you, and all these         things coming at us. </p>      <p>Timmy, from the first time he met me, he just really liked me. Paolo         and Jeffrey are funny. Rahim and Karim liked the balloon horse and dog         that they got at Aunt Marnie's birthday party at Chevy's where we walked         from the hotel. Aunt Marnie got a big sombrero and all the waiters sang         a birthday song. Tita Malu's house is nice. When we landed back at the         Portland airport, I called my mom, and she said to tell Grampa to be careful         driving home because it was, like, 29 degrees. </p>    </td>    <td width="112" height="310">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="33">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="508">      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><a href="../contents.html"><font size="-1">HOME</font></a></p>    </td>    <td width="112">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="33">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="508"><a href="../dimsum/dimsum.html"><img src="../backlight.gif" width="72" height="72" align="right" alt="Back" border="0"></a></td>    <td width="112"><a href="../christmascards/christmascards.html"><img src="../nextlight.gif" width="72" height="72" align="left" alt="Next" border="0"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
