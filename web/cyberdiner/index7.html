We like them both because Uncle V races mountainbicycles and Gina shares her cookies. <BR><BR>August 13, 1996 <BR><BR>Joel spent the weekend at Grandma Nini and Grandpa Dan's house in Mortonfor the "granddaddy of all logging shows", the The Logger's Jubilee. He watchedthe Jubilee Parade twice, and learned to shout "throw candy!" as the antiquecars, logging trucks and floats drove by. Then he played with his cousinson the carnival rides (the pink slide was the favorite) until the sun wentdown. <BR><BR>June 12, 1996 <BR><BR>Joel's on summer vacation now from One Day Toddler Preschool, but he occasionallymeets with his friends on sunny days at the Lincoln Park playground. He'sspending summer vacation climbing in the treehouse at Grandma Nini and GrampaDan's house, and helping daddy wash the car. Recommended viewing for thesummer include the classics The Muppet Movie and Mary Poppins (which incidentlystars Dick Van Dyke, also in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang). <BR><BR>May 11, 1996 <BR><BR>The opulent MS Ryndam of Holland America Lines came to Seattle as it traveledto Vancover BC to finish its Panama Canal cruise. Joel went on board to visitGrandma and Grampa. He played the drums in the Crow's Nest Sports Bar, deckgames with Grandma, and stuck his hands in the outdoors salt water pool.Very cool! <BR><BR><P align = left><IMG align=top height =246 width =360border = 0 SRC="daddywithtrains.GIF"><BR><P align =left>Joel and Daddy play Brio -- Uncle Ricky sends this image from Christmas 1995.<BR><P align = left><A HREF ="index.html"><IMG align=top height =104 width =72 border = 2 SRC="smallhat.GIF"></A>&nbsp;&lt;----- back home!<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="dancinsquares.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="14"></BODY></HTML>
