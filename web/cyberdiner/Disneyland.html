TOAD'S WILD RIDE.&nbsp;A statue of Mr. Toad himself graces the entrance to his house as youwait in line to ride in an "ah-oo-gah" car that takes you through a fireplace,brick walls, head-on into a locomotive and straight to hell! &nbsp;We don'tknow the story of Mr. Toad, but he must have been very naughty!&nbsp;<P><BIG>BEST OF CRITTER COUNTRY</BIG><P>Coming in a very close second for all-around best ride of the park: SPLASHMOUNTAIN. &nbsp;A gentle ride in a hollowed-out log through tunnels filledwith furry singing creatures precedes a free fall down a five-story waterfall!&nbsp;Barely reaching the 40 inch minimum height requirement, Joel went onthis ride four times until we couldn't take anymore. See<A HREF="splashmountain.gif">Joel and Daddy screaming</A> down the falls!<P><BIG>BEST OF MAIN STREET, U.S.A.</BIG><P>Ride an old-time fire engine down Main Street, then ride an old-time doubledecker bus back while a barbershop quartet sings in the background!<P><BIG>BEST OF ADVENTURELAND </BIG><P>Little-known unadvertised attractions are the broken-down army jeep loadedwith empty crates parked in front of the Enchanted Tiki Room (probably usedas a fruit stand during the summer), and the cargo truck with a brokenheadlight&nbsp;parked in front of the Jungle Cruise. Too cool!<P><BIG>BEST OF TOONTOWN</BIG><P>GADGET'S GO-COASTER lasts about ten seconds. &nbsp;Joel's comment: "Let'sdo it again!"<P><BIG>BEST OF FRONTIERLAND</BIG><P>Get lost exploring&nbsp;the caves in TOM SAWYER'S ISLAND. &nbsp;But don'tgo into Injun Joe's cave&nbsp;(too dark and scary, even for Joel)!<P><BIG>BEST PLACE TO EAT</BIG><P>Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Pluto and Goofy party all day at GOOFY'S KITCHEN&nbsp;atthe Disneyland Hotel during breakfast, lunch and dinner (Piglet is conspicuouslyabsent). &nbsp;They all come to your table! &nbsp;It takes a little suspensionof disbelief, even for Joel ("They're costume guys, Dad!") &nbsp;If you don'tmind Goofy's cooking (served in an all-you-can-eat buffet style), and occasionalpauses to sing Happy Birthday to patrons in the next table, this place isthe best!<P>  <HR><P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="kodakcamara.gif" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="112"><BIG><BIG>PICTURES!</BIG></BIG><P><SMALL><CITE>Taken with a $9.00 disposable camera.</CITE></SMALL><BR clear = all>Mommy and Joel stand along the Marina at the<A HREF="disneylandhotel.gif">DISNEYLAND HOTEL</A>. &nbsp;<P><A HREF="kingarthurs.gif">KING ARTHUR'S CAROUSEL</A> in the center of Fantasyland-- a hundred horses and they're all white!<P>Outside of <A HREF="mrtoad.gif">MR.
