Laico who,since 1940, has devoted himself to this branch of surgery. &nbsp;This case,the first of its type, would have taken less time to complete if such aidsas penicillin and the sulfa drugs had been known then.<P>He was further handicapped by the coming of the war and had to perform thelast stages of the operation under trying circumstances. &nbsp;Nonetheless,he had another case in 1942, a 12-year-old boy who sustained a shrapnel woundin the chest. This was followed by another, shortly after Liberation.&nbsp;Since then, he has been having a steady flow of patients.<P>A member of the Philippine College of Surgeons and presently one of theconsulting surgeons of the PGH and an instructor of the department of surgery,U.P. College of Medicine, Dr. Laico is the first Filipino known to have attemptedthe practice of plastic surgery. &nbsp;He demonstrated a plastic operationon the nose at the PGH during the First Philippine Surgical Congress lastDecember.<P>Following graduation at the U.P., the Laguna-born (Magdelena) surgeon wasresident in surgery at the PGH for five years, served as director of Albayprovincial hospital and later of the Los Banos infirmary. &nbsp;Dr. Laicohas not been abroad, and learned plastic-surgery methods by painstaking andextensive research in the medical literature.<P><A HREF="index18.html"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="JaimeLaicoIcon" WIDTH="54"    HEIGHT="74"></A></BODY></HTML>
