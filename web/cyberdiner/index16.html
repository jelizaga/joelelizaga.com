Jimenez<P>"The number one cause of wrinkles in women is the use of too much cosmetics,"says Dr. Jaime Laico, noted plastic surgeon specialist in the country today.<P>"I cannot say exactly what in the quality or what specific element in cosmeticsthat bring about these wrinkles, but it is my own personal experience ofmany years, that women I have performed face lifting operations on, distinctlyexhibited the overuse of cosmetics."<P>According to Dr. Laico who is president of the Philippine College of Surgeons,a series of specific cosmetic labels to warn women against using them.<P>"I am talking of cosmetics in general whether it is the best produced cosmeticsin the market or the poorly manufactured cosmetic, the effect, if used toomuch, is the same."<P>Dr. Laico further said that he wished he could throw a more definite lighton this subject but "I cannot be technical in my terms and still be understood.''<P>But he explained that this cause-and-effect situation may be clarified bysimply saying that in the use of too much cosmetics, certain vital pores,performing re-vitalizing functions must be continuously kept free from anyamount of clogging. Now with the cosmetics on the face, these pores are cloggedand blocked with all sorts of grease the whole day."<P>However the surgeon stressed that he does not mean that there must be a totalabstinence from cosmetics if women desire to keep their faces in an unwrinkledcondition.<P>"In the first place, this is impossible," Dr. Laico declared,'' since ata certain age women whether they had carefully preserved their facial surfaceor not, will get wrinkles just the same. But then the idea is to minimizethese lines. And certainly it cannot be done by heaping make-up on the faceto bury these lines."<P>According to Dr. Laico, it is common practice of women who are well-advancedin middle-age telling hopefully to ("hopelessly would be the better wordfor it") a youth past and gone, by covering themselves with a lot of paint.<P>''They think, that by doing so, they hide the obvious. But they cannot bemore wrong, since they are instead stressing the obvious."<P>Dr. Laico is giving out pointers for proper facial care suggests a "minimumuse of make-up. Women should start early by using as little as possible.After every application, I recommend a thorough cleansing of the face withold-fashioned soap and water."<P>Dr. Laico pointed out as examples people in the entertainment business. "Theyhave so much make-up most of the time that without this make up, their skingives out a sallow, saggy effect. There seems to be not one fresh pore inthe entire facial surface. They are not to blame, for that is the demandof their profession. But I urge those who can avoid using tons of make-upto do just that and see how much fresher and cooler the entire face willappear to be."<P>"There is nothing like a fresh clean scrubbed face devoid of mud packs andcreams. It is unhealthy to have that on in your face," Dr. Laico says.<P>Dr. Laico assures the women who have all along been using moderate makeupof an almost unlined face up to middle-age.<P><A HREF="index13.html"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="JaimeLaicoIcon" WIDTH="54"    HEIGHT="74"></A></BODY></HTML>
