Laico</A> of the Philippine GeneralHospital has been resorting to the tube flap method as early as 1940.<P>His first case (probably the first in Philippine plastic surgery) was a4-year-old boy who had an inch-wide hole in the left cheek due to <I>cancrumorris</I> &nbsp;(rotting of the flesh) as a complication of measles. &nbsp;Thepatient's tongue, gums, and teeth could be seen (<I>photo at extreme left</I>)through the opening, out of which saliva constantly leaked.<P>If the boy were older, skin for transplant could have been taken from hisleft arm, and the operation would have been simpler. &nbsp;Since nobody couldtell how long he could hold his left arm immobile to his left cheek, thelonger but safer method had to be performed.<P>The operation took several stages (<I>photos below and on the next page</I>),a longer period due to lack of facilities -- a little over a year -- anda lot of patience. &nbsp;Nevertheless, when it was over, the boy (<I>extremeright</I>) was no longer a pitiful sight.<P>Skin for transplant was finally selected from the left side of the chest.&nbsp;That being looser than any other part of the body below the neck, thepatient would not carry a disfiguring scar.<P>Two longitudinal incisions, each about 5 inches long and 2-1/2 inches apartwere made, the skin undermined, and its edges sutured posteriorly. &nbsp;Theraw surface created was also approximated by interrupted stitches after itsedges had been undermined. &nbsp;Thus a vertical tube flap <I>(1)</I>, notunlike the handle of a suitcase, was created, its two ends being the onlyportions attached to the patient's body.<P>In about a month's time, the flap was ready for its creeping operations upward.&nbsp;Cut down to the subcutaneous layer, the lower end of the flap was loosenedfrom its place and turned up to be attached to a centimeter-wide incisionalso cut deep into the subcutaneous layer above the left nipple <I>(2).</I><P>After another month, the flap went a step higher to the infraclavicular region(<I>3</I>). &nbsp;Similar operations followed, with the tube nearing itsobjective after going from clavicle <I>(4)</I>, to shoulder <I>(5)</I>, andup to the neck <I>(6).</I> &nbsp;<P>The next stage carried the flap to the mastoid region, then to the posteriorangle of the scar close to the maxilla <I>(7).</I> &nbsp;The lower end wasnext detached and transplanted below the hole. &nbsp;From here, the upperend of the flap was incised at the edge <I>(8).</I> &nbsp;The scar closeto the infraorbital region was cut off and to it the loose end of the tubewas sutured doubly; inner edge to inner edge, outer edge to outer edge ofthe wound <I>(9).</I><P>Union of the tube flap with the infraorbital region took place within theweek, but left unavoidable skin excess <I>(10),</I> which was trimmed offafter two weeks. &nbsp;The edges of the remaining flap were sutured by twolayers.<P>Finishing touches consisted of excising the depressed scars around the transplantand leveling the grafted skin to the cheek.<P><A HREF="skingraftingseries.GIF"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="skingraftingicon"    ALT="Icon for the skin grafting image series" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="151"></A>SELECTICON TO VIEW FULL IMAGE (about 260 K)<P><P><P><P><P><P><BR CLEAR=all><A HREF="index13.html"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="JaimeLaicoIcon" ALT="Back to Table of Contents"    WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="74"></A></BODY></HTML>
