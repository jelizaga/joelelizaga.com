It is a prerequisite of beauty,an index of social caste, an anthropological clue.<P>A high-bridged nose, for example, growing out of a Filipino foreheadEuropean-fashion, sharp, proud and with fleshless nostrils is a valuablepiece of property. Being a testimonial of at least one white ancestor, sucha nose may land one in Filipino films, in a Spanish-speaking firm with apreferential salary or in the esoteric parties of Manila society.<P>In this nose-conscious milieu a man like Dr. Jaime E. Laico is inevitablydescribed as a nose-lifter. In any other environment he would be called aplastic surgeon which is, after all, what he is. Among other things, Dr.Laico is the possessor of the important skill of lifting noses to the properaristocratic angle.<P>The process includes a one-hour operation during which Dr. Laico, who hasa good-sized, high-bridged nose of his own, administers local anaesthesia,makes an incision immediately under the tip of the offending nose, and graftsonto the original and insufficient bone another piece of bone taken fromthe patient's hip. The nose then remains swathed in bandages for seven days,takes another week to heal completely. The patient is afterwards discharged,better than new. In two exciting weeks the improved-upon nose has becomeas high and as caucasian as the rest of the patient's face will allow itto be.<P>Although there is another, shorter cut to a long nose: a paraffin injectioninto the bridge of the nose, Dr. Laico does not believe in it. He says, that,in time, the paraffin melts, lets the nose down and, what's worse, descendsto the tip where it becomes a bulbous, unaesthetic protuberance.<P>The nose-lifting operation, more expensive and longer than the paraffin method,is a guaranteed permanent job, for the hip bone grafted on the nose becomesa part of the nose itself. Boxers, victims of accidents and congenital odditiesmake up a large-part of the nose-lifting practice. Children who play aboutwith seeds and cereal grains and push them into their nostrils accidentally,causing infection and caving of the nose are often operated on too.<P>About the other patients whose nose-lifting is purely vanity, Dr. Laico isthoroughly discreet. He believes, as we have said, that Filipinos are dreadfullysensitive about their noses.<P>Actually, the nose-lifting is only a part of Dr. Laico's varied practice.A graduate of the UP College of Medicine class 1930, Dr. Laico first becameinterested in another branch of plastic surgery, skin grafting, when in 1937,after treating a woman for a severe case of face burns, he was shocked bythe ghastly case of contracture which affected her lips, chin and neck. Herlower lip had been dragged down and out so that her teeth were exposed andthe line of chin and neck cruelly stretched straight down to her chest.<P>Then a resident of surgery at the Philippine General Hospital, Dr. Laicowas haunted by the woman's appearance. He began to read plastic surgery manuals,and training and teaching himself, he performed a tube flap skin-graftingoperation by raising a tube of undamaged skin from the patient's abdomen,bringing it up to her chest in another operation and up to her neck in stillanother, to form the new skin for the ravaged part of her lower face. Theoperation was successful. Except for a slight pout the woman was back tonormal after a few months.<P>In 1940 he performed <A HREF="index18.html">another major operation</A>,also self-taught, during which he patched up a large hole on a baby's cheek(a buccal fistula). In one sense Dr. Laico has followed the pattern of manypioneering Filipino scientists who, by experimenting and self-study, madeup for adequate foreign training.<P>The nose-lifting technique, however, Dr. Laico learned abroad. For, in l949,in recognition of his brilliant operations, he was named a UNICEF Fellow.He traveled to the United States and Europe, studying and observing foremostplastic surgeons, among them Kazanjian of Boston, James Barrett Brown ofSt. Louis, Mo., Gordon of New Rochester, Minn, John Converse of New YorkCity, Kilner, McIndoe and Gillies of England and Professor Calabro of Bologna,Italy.<P>Dr. Laico is now himself a professor at the UP College of Surgery with alarge private practice which includes operations for harelip, cleft palate,skin grafting to remove scars and other deformities, congenital underdevelopmentof one side of the face, contracture due to burns, cancer of the scalp andbone grafting.<P>Except for the time he spends with his wife and eight children, Dr. Laicohas no interest or preoccupation other than improving the looks of hisfellow-men, by means of surgery. His branch of medicine, he believes, notonly makes people well - it makes them good-looking and happy. There is nobetter therapy, when all is said, than being pleased with oneself.<P>Dr Laico's latest patient is a middle-aged Filipino bachelor, hampered inhis search for a wife by, ironically, a too long nose. He has been operatedon, his nose pared down to more handsome proportions, and he is now a happyman, confident of his looks and eligibility.<P>"What I could have spared Cyrano de Bergerac," says Dr. Laico, "if I hadknown him."<P><A HREF="index13.html"><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="JaimeLaicoIcon" WIDTH="54"    HEIGHT="74"></A><P><P><P><P><A HREF="noseseriesI.GIF"><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="noseicon" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="151"></A><FONT    SIZE=-1>Max Factor was never like this.
