		<p>
			This is my <i>INFO 343 - Client Side Web Development</i> portfolio, built to display the
			sites I built throughout the course. The portfolio implements Angular and its UI Router
			("the de-facto solution to flexible routing with nested views"), reading data off of a
			JSON file. I considered using Angular when building joelelizaga.com, but doing so would
			break fundamental navigation across the entire site for visitors who have JavaScript
			disabled.
		</p>
		<p>
			My site works without JavaScript, believe it or not. Try it out. I'm not even sure
			why I made a point of building it like that. It's for finicky people who run NoScript,
			I suppose.
