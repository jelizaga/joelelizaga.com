				Black Jack is the protagonist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_%28manga%29">a childrens' manga series from the 1970's</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka.</a>
				He's a notorious unlicensed surgeon who charges exorbitant prices for procedures and 
				lives in a tiny cabin atop a remote cliff with a walking, talking tumor named Pinoko.
				Typically he ends up saving lives from bizarre diseases based on actual medical cases 
				or steps into depressing moral quandaries that aren't always resolved by the end of the
				chapter. Osamu Tezuka's art is usually very simple until the surgeries are performed; 
				the artist's background in medicine shines through with the meticulous medical 
				procedures and anatomy.

				Black Jack's a decent fictional hero. Like Bat Man, he doesn't have any unobtainable 
				super powers, and he does have some dead parents. Unlike Bat Man, he drives an old, 
				crappy black car, has a skin-graft on his face and his power is more of a matter of 
				skill, rather than wealth. It's the kind of heroism and capability that a normal person 
				can aspire to. I think he's pretty overlooked in comparison to Tezuka's more 
				popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy">Astro Boy.</a>
