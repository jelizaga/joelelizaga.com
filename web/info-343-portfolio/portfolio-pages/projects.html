<p>
	A gargantuan <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/">hackintosh</a> meant to be a cheaper, 
	upgradeable rival to the 2013 Mac Pro. Ever
	since Apple started soldering the RAM into their Mac Minis and sealing them shut I decided
	I'd just build my own. Nobody pays $200 for 16 GB, dude. Currently running OS X, Linux Mint,
	and Windows 10 all on separate drives so I don't have to worry about accidentally formatting
	partitions or not being able to use school-required software due to whatever OS I'm using.
	Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buko_pie">Philippine coconuts.</a>

<p>
	A gift for my sister's birthday, accompanied with a USB drive with playlists of hip hop
	sorted by regional origin. This is more of an alpha-version of an ongoing project; I've got
	something like 100+ songs per coast currently. The 38-page libretto includes historical
	tidbits pertaining to the playlists themselves, which are organized in a semi-chronological
	order (but tone, theme, style, etc. have precedence over this).
	A final, publishable version will have to have non-copywritten images. I bet I could find an
	art student to crank those out.

<h3>
	An INFO 200 Group Project

<p>
	A group project for INFO 200. I'm putting this here because I was crazy enough to buy some
	watercolor board and paint this thing on the floor of my apartment with one of those tiny
	paintbrushes that come with the plastic kits.

<h3>
	Sunset - A GTK Theme
</h3>

<p>
	Sunset is my modified version of 
	<a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Y-mix?content=170307">
	Y-Mix,</a> which is, in turn, inspired by the UI of OS X
	Yosemite. Basically, I wanted something to match the flat sunset I've currently
	got as my background. So far only the GTK 2.0 and Metacity versions are finished, and it's
	likely that I'll only update the others (Cinnamon, openbox, Unity) when I have to use them.
