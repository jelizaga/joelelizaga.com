	One of my pasttimes is directing and editing movies; here's what I've recently produced for 
	various classes at the University of Washington and the Evergreen State College.

	An over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek reinterpretation of the Battle of Marathon, written by 
	Seth Michel and produced for Mira Green's HSTAM 205 class. Featured in <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/history/stories/uw-history-students-show-their-cinematic-flair">her film festival.</a>
	I mixed a substantial amount of public domain footage from <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> with contemporary
	footage to thicken it; we were told to produce a 20 minute video, but it's been my experience
	that each minute of video requires approximately 1 hour of editing.
	I'm currently directing and editing the video resume of my co-director from this project.

<p>
	A "self-representation" project produced for an experimental media class at Evergreen,
	exploring the tradeoffs and cultural atmospheres that come with generational stages of
	technological evolution. Well over half of the video is pulled from a substantial b-roll of
	pixel art and animations that I drew up in Pixen, frame by frame.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aiZaaVquos">Chinese New Year</a> Winter 2014
</h3>

<img src="movie-pics/chinese-new-year/cny1.png" class="widescreen-screenshot" alt="Title." />
<img src="movie-pics/chinese-new-year/cny3.png" class="widescreen-screenshot" alt="Nian, mythical beast and giant articulated puppet." />
<img src="movie-pics/chinese-new-year/cny4.png" class="widescreen-screenshot" alt="Kites, representing innocent villagers." />

<p>
	A short stop-motion animation I produced with Wade Joliff that took an insane amount of
	arduous effort to animate, due to the fact that we shot the thing in 24 FPS. That's 24 camera
	clicks, (24 * PUPPETS_ON_SCREEN) movements of articulated puppets, and (24 * TURNS) turns of the
	animation table's gears (if the backdrop is moving) per second worth of video.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymWkfSY0tU">Hippo</a> Fall 2014
</h3>

<img src="movie-pics/hippo/hip1.png" class="fullscreen-screenshot" alt="The sun gazes upon an island in the middle of the ocean." />
<img src="movie-pics/hippo/hip2.png" class="fullscreen-screenshot" alt="The island is populated solely by a happily oblivious hippo." />
<img src="movie-pics/hippo/hip3.png" class="fullscreen-screenshot" alt="The hippo finds this pretty funny." />
<img src="movie-pics/hippo/hip4.png" class="fullscreen-screenshot" alt="THE HAND." />

<p>
	Originally a practical joke: Leveraging static-holds and the fact that the animation can be
	endlessly looped and still keep a coherent story, I turned in a 30-minute video for this assignment.
