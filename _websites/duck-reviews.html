			This is a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app I developed using Parse and AJAX for an INFO 343 assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a bunch of ducks reviewing the University of Washington.

			NOTE: Unfortunately, the <a href="http://parseplatform.org/">Parse</a> service that this
			application ran on has since shut down. They appear to have open-sourced the backend,
			but I won't be porting the app to return Duck Reviews to functionality.
