			Basic Stuff

		<p>
			The first assignment of my <i>INFO 343 - Client-Side Web Development</i> class was to 
			create a simple single-page site devoted to a fictional character.
		</p>
		<p>
			I chose Osamu Tezuka's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_%28manga%29">
			Black Jack.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Essentially, this assignment was practice in rudimentary HTML, git and ssh'ing into
			university servers.
