**[5 Charms Travel](https://5charmstravel.com)** is a travel agency specialized
in organizing custom, one-of-a-kind adventures.

I was tasked with redesigning and rebuilding the agency's flagship 
point-of-sales on the web, `5charmstravel.com`, in order to boost conversions, 
improve accessibility, implement a new sales funnel-based marketing strategy, 
and develop a novel and fun experience for clients that would carry into their 
vacations.

## Design

### Home Page

<Media
  src={`${mediaPath}/home-old.jpg`}
  caption="**Original** home page, pre-redesign."
/>

***Home page*** *highlights:*

* Prominent and consistent *calls-to-action.*
* *Distinctive branding and visual design,* improving ease-of-use through
  consistency, usage through novelty, and evoking the headspace of travel,
  opportunity, relaxation, optimism, and adventure.
* *Sorting of content in order of importance and relevance to users,* with 
  adventures at the very top.
* *Adventures carousel,* highlighting the suite of customizable adventures 
  proferred for users to explore and consider.
* *Testimonials,* showcasing the experiences of happy clients.
* *Consistent IxD grammar,* reducing cognitive load.
* *Skeumorphic fun:* Instant-film photographs and dog-eared sticky-notes, 
  creating a sense of memorable tangibility.
* *Generally adventure-focused above-the-fold header image,* in order to cater 
  to a wide demographic (non-Disney-specific).

### Forms 

<Media
  aspectRatio="9 / 16"
  arr={[
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-old.jpg`,
      alt: "Original Book Your Trip form.",
      caption: "**Original** *Book Your Trip* form."

    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/contact-old.jpg`,
      alt: "Original Contact form.",
      caption: "**Original** *Contact* form."
    }
  ]}
/>

<Media
  aspectRatio="9 / 16"
  arr={[
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-1.jpg`,
      alt: "Newly redesigned Book Adventure form.",
      caption: "**Newly redesigned** *Book Adventure* form."
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-2-disney.jpg`,
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-2-generic.jpg`,
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-3-disney.jpg`,
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-4-disney.jpg`,
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-4-generic.jpg`
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/book-new-5.jpg`
    }
  ]}
/>

***Form*** *highlights:*

* *Progressive disclosure:* The UX principle of *progressive disclosure* is used
  to reduce fatigue and form bounce rates. By dividing the *Book Adventure* form 
  into five distinct and labeled steps, users are propelled by a sense of
  accomplishment with each successive 'section' completed.
* *Conditional logic:* Depending on the adventures selected, the form adjusts to
  collect relevant details. Say you're going to Disneyland: the new *Book
  Adventure* form will collect Disneyland-specific
  preferences with regards to accommodations and activities.
* *Recognition > recall:* Adventures options are represented with the same
  images and labels as they are elsewhere on the site, minimizing the effort of
  identification and selection.
* *Zero redundancy:* The original site had `3` forms, all with the same purpose;
  the redesign has `1`, which every call-to-action points towards.

### Blog

  arr={[
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/blog-new-index.jpg`
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/blog-new-post.jpg`
    },
    {
      src: `${mediaPath}/blog-old.jpg`
    }
  ]}
/>

***Blog*** *highlights:*

* *Blog post → adventure associations:* Allowing users to filter blog posts to 
  read about the adventures they find most compelling.
* *Persistent newsletter sign-up call-to-action,* in service of marketing and 
  maintaining brand visibility.
* *Related blog posts* posted at the bottom of each post, improving low funnel
  marketing and suggesting further posts for users interested in specific
  adventures and similar content.

### Adventures

    }
  ]}
/>

<Media
  src={`${mediaPath}/adventures-index.jpg`}
  caption="*Adventures* index—a new addition to `5charmstravel.com`."

***Adventures*** *highlights:*

* *Visually-rich and modular components* effectively illustrating the 
  activities, accommodations, amenities, ambience, and opportunities of 
  adventures.
* *Adventure-specific testimonials.*
* *Effective UX writing heuristics,* improving the legibility and scannability
  of content.

## Development

### Backend

The original `5charmstravel.com` was a WordPress site designed by 
[GoDaddy design services](https://www.godaddy.com/studio) and hosted on 
`GoDaddy.com`.

I decided to rebuild the site with a headless CMS:

* A good headless CMS is *easy for non-developers to use.* Content can be 
  effortlessly authored and updated by the client and their employees to fit
  business needs and the evolution of the market. Rapid changes are possible 
  without the intervention of a web developer.
* A headless CMS decouples the content from WordPress' schemas and the plugins
  required to fit it into reusable components, optimizing *ease-of-maintenance:*
  There's no plugins to update or keep an eye on for stagnant
  development.
* Pulling content from a headless CMS to a static site frontend *reduces
  vulnerability 'surface area.'*
* A headless CMS makes establishing relationships between content (say, a
  *blog post → adventure*, and *testimonial → adventure*) possible via a 
  relational database. This content and its relationality can be leveraged in 
  the future, if needed, to add more complex features.

### Frontend

I built the frontend using [Astro](https://astro.build) and
[SolidJS](https://solidjs.com).

Both were chosen for close-to-raw-JavaScript speed, since the site is
graphically 'heavy' with high-res pictures, and the longer it takes a page to 
load, the greater the bounce rate and the worse the search engine rankings.

Astro is perfect for static sites, as the developer experience is similar to 
popular reactive frameworks, but it's geared towards building static multi-page 
applications instead of SPAs. 

A SPA wouldn't be appropriate for
`5charmstravel.com`, as the site uses blog posts and content to draw traffic,
and a virtual DOM wouldn't be so awesome for that. Well-structured, plain HTML
is better for SEO.
