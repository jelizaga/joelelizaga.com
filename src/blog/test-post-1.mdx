From November'ish of 2023 onwards any intangible form of creativity may very
well be the product of an artificial intelligence distributed throughout
dozens of steel cabinets humming with warm silicon in a data center far away, or,
at least, partially created in collaboration with an AI.

And there's just something really funny about starting a blog in this 
ever-growing shade of AI's rise; a charming anachronism that smells like motor
oil and looks as brassy and antique as the massive steam-powered cars in Jay 
Leno's garage.

OpenAI's ChatGPT has been cranking out fully defensible, skillfully coherent 
code, prose, poetry, humor, articles, guides, lessons, and conversation in
multiple languages and with alien prodigy for months.

Watch the rapidity of this thing as it carves through a dissertation on the
lives and social positioning of Chinese-Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule:

To achieve this same *exact* feat and at this *exact* speed, a
person would...:

* have to massage that information into their brains with enough study 
  for it to pass from recall and into recognition—becoming as 
  effortlessly retrievable and recitable as *tying their shoelaces*
* require superhuman recall in the first place
* need incredible verbal skill to render their writing both accessible,
  enjoyable, and rich in content with such ease

Now—remember that twenty years from now, this screencap of ChatGPT that I've 
embedded above will look as ancient to us as the *cutting-edge* technological
artifacts of 2003:

And remember that these AI models feed and grow through the infinite rivers
of yotabytes that human civilization produces:

That's almost every sound, every song, every image, every video, every conversation,
every artifice, every known and studied organism, every design, every book,
every blog, every stream—available on the web.

And, for now, this process of AI maturation is only impeded by the cost of
electricity, the number of transistors we can cram on a chip, and facile
legalities of intellectual property that can be 
circumvented by tacitly scraping the web with `curl` scripts.

For example:

* there's a likelihood that ChatGPT scrapes some of its data from Reddit, as
  indicated by a handful of usernames triggering errors in the chatbot,
* GitHub Copilot was trained on the millions of open source projects hosted on
  GitHub's servers—though this could just be the permissively-licensed or 
  unlicensed projects

Just this last month we witnessed a fraction of Steve Jobs' essence risen from
the grave through a
