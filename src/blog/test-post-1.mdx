From November'ish of 2023 onwards any intangible form of creativity may very
well be the product of an artificial intelligence distributed throughout
dozens of steel cabinets humming with warm silicon in a data center far away,
or at least, partially created in collaboration *with* an AI.

And there's just something awfully funny about starting a blog in this 
ever-growing shade of AI's rise; a charming anachronism that smells like motor
oil and looks as brassy and antique as the massive steam-powered cars in Jay 
Leno's garage. Writing a blog in 2023 next to the incredible proficiency of
contemporary AI is like hunting a sea lion while sitting in a wobbly
skin-on-frame kayak with a wooden harpoon while a gas-powered waterborne factory
plaughs a trawl net through the sea floor, scooping up countless fish, sea flora
and junk with mechanical zeal.

You know—it's spectacular.

Watch the rapidity of ChatGPT as it carves through a dissertation on the
lives and social positioning of Chinese-Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule:

To achieve this same *exact* feat and at this *exact* speed, a
person would...:

* have to massage that information into their brains with enough study 
  for it to pass from cognitive recall and into recognition—becoming as 
  effortlessly retrievable and recitable as *tying their shoelaces,*
* require superhuman recall in the first place,
* and need incredible verbal skill to render their writing both accessible,
  enjoyable, and rich in content with such ease.

And this person would have to never sleep, eat, rest, or be burdened
by other biological realities like sickness, senescence, discontentment, and
the limitation of being in a single location at any given time that might impede 
their ability to deliver these responses every single day, every moment, and 
everywhere with connection to the internet.

Now—remember that twenty years from now, this screencap of ChatGPT that I've 
embedded above will look as ancient to us as the *cutting-edge* technological
artifacts of 2003:


And remember that these AI models feed and grow through the infinite rivers
of yotabytes that human civilization produces:

That's almost every sound, every song, every image, every video, every 
conversation, every artifice, every known and studied organism, every design, 
every book, every blog, every stream—available on the web and ripe for parsing.

Artificial intelligence is the gestalt of our noisy interactions on the web, 
distilled into a superhuman signal. That figurative trawler next to my 
wobbly blog-kayak is fueled by the data we feed it with our every action, sold 
to or scraped by artificial intelligence.

And, for now, this process of AI maturation is only impeded by 
the cost of electricity, the rapidly rising ceiling of investment into these
technologies, the number of transistors we can cram on a chip, and 
facile legalities of intellectual property that can be 
circumvented by tacitly scraping the web with `curl` scripts and concealing
the exact sources of data within the incoherent noise of countless other
sources.

When every interaction online can be the product of a digital homunculi, when 
every voice (audio and textual) can be deconstructed and repurposed to enact
the fantasies of humans and computers like shiny pieces of Lego, every face can 
be stitched onto a virtual marionette or subsumed into the construction of a
wholly nonexistant human—to some theorists, the internet as we knew it, as a 
forum where humans convene and make things—is 'dead.'

So, why am I writing a blog? 

Should we even be in the water? 

Why hunt with a harpoon in a kayak when you can feed cities with a trawler or 
two?

You can't be in a *Godzilla*
movie without running into the streets and pointing at Godzilla at some point,
right? You really need that scene where you, the scientists, the top brass of
the military, the single parent and his/her kid and the extraterrestrials all 
get together and contend with the existential dread of Godzilla. It's just not 
*Finding Nemo* if Nemo isn't drawn by the spectacle of the dentist's boat to 
touch the hull to impress his friends and ends up in a fish tank in Sydney. 
Alright:
