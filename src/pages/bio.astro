						Hey there!

					<p>
						I'm <b>Joel Elizaga</b>. I'm a <code>UX engineer</code> and
						technologist fueled by a fascination for human-computer 
						interaction and informatics to build technologies that advance 
						human thriving.

					<p>
						I served a year in
						<a href="https://americorps.gov/nccc" target="_blank">AmeriCorps NCCC</a>
						(<em>National Civilian Community Corps</em>)
						after graduating university, where I was assigned to the 
						southwestern United States. My team worked three major service 
						projects in partnerships with non-profit sponsors:

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I found NCCC to be an awesome exhibit of the restorative magic
						and strength of diversity:
					</p>
					<p>
						Corps members converge from across the U.S. from a kaleidoscope of
						experiences, abilities, cultures, economic disparities,
						personal convictions, and identities to
						work, eat, and live together while on a mission to strengthen
						communities across the nation. A prospering AmeriCorps team leverages
						its differences as strengths, effecting restorative change and
						building the resilient capacities of these communities which are 
						equally unique and just as diverse in their stories, circumstances,
						and needs.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe that designing and developing technology that advances 
						human thriving requires a somewhat similar system; intentional 
						accountability to the users and stakeholders effected by the 
						technology, as well as an interfusion of a wide manifold of skills, 
						knowledge, perspectives, and experience that makes for complex, 
						resilient systems that can effectively adapt to challenges and 
						centers the needs and values of stakeholders.

						<em>Informatics Student</em> 
						@ University of Washington
					</h2>
					<p>
						I studied 
						<a

						>
							informatics
						</a> 
						with a focus in
						<a

						>
							University of Washington</a>, 
						graduating with my bachelors in 2017.
					</p>
					<p>
						The School of Information's mission is to train technologists who 
						<em>
							bend information technology towards equity and justice,
						</em>
						and it's home of the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab. During my
						studies I developed personal affinities for humane technologies,
						informatic integrity, and
						open-source software.
					</p>	
					<p>
						UW's School of Information is a fairly small department (my 
						undergraduate cohort was 33 students) with a heavily 
						interdisciplinarian and project-based curriculum designed to
						simulate the cross-domain collaboration of the tech industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						I specialized in HCI, supporting projects 
						with UX work and design, but I found aspects of developing software
						compelling in their own right. I've got a soft spot for the 
						technical and precise, and while I enjoyed designing experiences,
						the computer science curriculum taught me that I could build my own 
						tools out of ASCII characters and some logic, and I found that 
						enchanting enough to remain at the intersection of design and 
						development. As someone fascinated by technology, its design, and
						its cybernetically augmenting/psychosocial/cultural role in our
						lives, fussing around with the tools used to construct the stuff
						has its draw.

						and screen captures demonstrating the product, creating compelling 
						motion graphics that featured AnswerDash's snappy ease-of-use,

					<h3>... you're still here?</h3>
					<p>
						Okay, you win. Here's my obligatory ice-breaker 'fun facts':
					</p>
					<h4>Fun Fact #1: The time I met Ted Cruz</h4>
					<p>
						Once upon a time I met Senator Ted Cruz;
					  my AmeriCorps team was staffing 
						Generation One's donation booth at, get thisâa 1v1 charity
						basketball game between Cruz and Jimmy Kimmel; the "Blobfish
						Basketball Classic."
					</p>
					<p>
						Our team got front seats.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was a really bizarre event, because it was a game solely between
						two fairly out-of-shape dudes spectated by the completely
						packed
						colosseum-like bowl of Texas Southern University, and for the
						most part it was totally silent with the exception of their
						squeaking sneakers and heavy panting blasting over the PA
						speakers as they blocked each other's shots for 2 hours and
						took intermittent breaks to very politely trash talk.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's not on my LinkedIn or resume, but I studied at the Evergreen
						State College for two years prior to transferring to the
						University of Washington.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, since corps members are forbidden from touching cash in public
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Evergreen is a local legend for having written transcripts
						</li>
						<li>
							Evergreen's mascot is the
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoduck">geoduck</a>, 
							and our official motto is <em>omnia extares</em>, which
							translates to <em>let it all hang out.</em>
						</li>
						<li>
							I took a class on the <em>Evolution of Human Language</em>,
							which was co-taught by Bret Weinstein.
