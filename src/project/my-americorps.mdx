<a href="https://americorps.gov/" target="_blank">AmeriCorps</a> is the largest
grant-maker in the United States: It's an independent agency of the U.S.
government with the stated purpose of improving lives, strengthening
communities, and fostering civic engagement through service and volunteering.
The organization's projects range from disaster response to matters of economic
opportunity, environmental stewardship,
and education.

This awesome mission of AmeriCorps would be better
served with an updated web portal made usable through **accessible**, **clear**, **concise**,
**conventional**, and **purposeful** UX content that advances the AmeriCorps
voice and turns ladened
<a href="https://my.americorps.gov" target="_blank">My.AmeriCorps.gov</a> users
into *satisfied advocates of the program.*

## First: What is My AmeriCorps?

*My.AmeriCorps.gov* (My AmeriCorps) is the online nexus of the AmeriCorps 
operation.

Corps members, prospective corps members, team & unit leaders, staff, alumni, 
and non-profit sponsors all cross paths with the portal.

As an AmeriCorps alum I can attest that my unit regarded My.AmeriCorps.gov with
puzzled dread in the best of moments and frustration at worst. Here's a quick
tour:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "My AmeriCorps log in page: depicted on a 1920x1080 screen. If you're curious about the mysterious white space on the right: The site is 782px acrossâ€”always."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/home.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps landing page for alumni.",
      caption: "Corps member alum landing page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps Segal Award payment request page.",
      caption: "Form used by alumni to request Segal Award payments."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/help.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps help documentation.",
      caption: "Site help documentation."
    }
  ]}
  aspectRatio={"16 / 9"}
/>

## Defining the user journey: Alum Alan

**Alum Alan** is an AmeriCorps alum who wants to access the Segal Education
Award granted upon completion of his service to pay for some of his college
tuition.

In user story terms:

> *As an...* AmeriCorps alum 

> *I want to...* disburse my Segal education award 

> *So I can...* pay for educational expenses at a qualified institution.

I examined the My.AmeriCorps.gov experience from the eyes of Alum Alan on his
journey to education award disbursal.

## Evaluating & improving content usability

### 1. Heuristic evaluation

First I assessed the portal's UX content usability by performing a **heuristic
evaluation** on each page accessed along Alum Alan's journey.

I dropped a flag and left a note for every string with an opportunity to improve
on my usability heuristics (accessible, clear, concise, conventional,
purposeful):

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-heuristic-evaluation.jpg",
      alt: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps log in page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/home-heuristic-evaluation.jpg",
      alt: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps alum landing page.",
      caption: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps alum landing page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-heuristic-evaluation.jpg",
      alt: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps form to request Segal Award disbursal.",
      caption: "Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps form to request Segal Award disbursal."
    }
  ]}
  aspectRatio={"16 / 9"}
/>

Alan's journey on MyAmeriCorps.gov scored a modest 30.8% usability on my **UX
writing scorecard**:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/ux-content-usability-scorecard.png"
  alt="A scorecard evaluating the current usability of My AmeriCorps' UX content."
  display="protruding"
/>

#### Improvements

Awesome! Now we've identified precise points of usability issues and have a
taxonomy for how, exactly, each point needs improvement.

As a proof-of-concept, I drafted an improved log in page with writing that
fulfills the usability criteria and resolves the issues I documented:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised.jpg",
      alt: "My AmeriCorps log in page with revised UX content.",
      caption: "Revision: Log in page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised-tos-clicked.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the terms of service is selected.",
      caption: "Revision: Terms of service pop-up."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised-privacy-statement-clicked.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the privacy statement is selected.",
      caption: "Revision: Privacy statement pop-up."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "Original log in page, pre-revisions."
    }
  ]}
  aspectRatio="16 / 9"
/>

I made my edits with minimal changes to the existing UI and UX design, this 
being a UX writing case study.

My UX content revisions to the log in page have these key enhancements:

* A sectioned & labeled *'Apply to Serve' block* to stimulate AmeriCorps
  applications,
* Legalese in the form of *optionally clickable tooltips* rather than a heavy
  chunk of text anchoring the page and acting as a focal point,
* *Greater readability* with a 10th grade English maximum as rated by the 
  Flesch-Kincaid scale,[^1]
* *Verb-first* buttons,
* Buttons with a `<= 3` word maximum to reduce cognitive load,
* *Concision:* Irrelevant and redundant strings removed--again, to reduce
  cognitive load.

### 2. Narrative arc

Next I mapped the **narrative arc** of Alan's experience in order to analyze the
user journey with greater granularity. This technique of 'narrative arc' is
similar to the diagrammatic
[journey mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) 
found in UX design, but it's more fitted to evaluating UX content:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/current-journey.jpg"
  alt="Map of the current My AmeriCorps journey to Segal Award disbursal."
  display="protruding"
  caption="The current journey to Segal Award disbursal as ventured by persona Alum Alan."
/>

#### Improvements

Through this practice of mapping I discovered more pain-points across the alum's
journey, inspiring these improvements to the 'Request Education Award
Payment' screen:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-revised.jpg",
      alt: "My AmeriCorps log in page with revised UX content.",
      caption: "After refining the UX content: Context-specific tooltips, prioritized concision, purposeful and accessible text, and legal disclaimers displaying only when relevant."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-revised-submit.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the terms of service is selected.",
      caption: "Legal disclaimer displayed as a pop-up as a final step when the user finally clicks 'Submit.'"
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form.jpg",
      alt: "Original 'Request Education Award Payment' page, pre-revisions.",
      caption: "Original 'Request Education Award Payment' page, pre-revisions: UI buttons hidden as labels, a lot of legal text, college-level vocabulary, an innaccurate diagram, and help buttons hyperlinked to unnavigable and out-of-date documentation."
    }
  ]}
  aspectRatio="16 / 9"
/>

## Evaluating & improving content voice

The existing voice of My.AmeriCorps.gov may be perceived as formidably
bureaucratic. Users may find it inaccessible and overwhelming:

> *On each page along the left side is a set of links leading to different parts
  of My AmeriCorps. By clicking on these links, you can navigate through the 
  system and view the various benefits of the system. From My AmeriCorps, you
  can do things such as update your contact information, print out tax
  information and have access to AmeriCorps benefits. These links will vary 
  depending on the type of AmeriCorps program you are serving and whether or not
  you are currently serving or have completed your term of service.*

> *To complete your Education Award payment request, please verify that your
  personal information is correct, enter in the amount of money you are
  authorizing, choose a payment type, and select your Institution. Upon
  completing the form, click the "submit" button to forward your request.*

> *Please click submit button ONCE. Do not click back button or refresh your browser.*

Luckily, AmeriCorps has a well-crafted and recognizable brand voice on
[*AmeriCorps.gov*](https://americorps.gov) that can be referenced for pointers
on how the agency would like to represent itself:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/americorps-dotgov.png",
      alt: "Screenshot of the AmeriCorps.gov site, where the brand voice is pretty inviting and action-oriented.",
      caption: "AmeriCorps.gov: Content designed to advocate for the agency's programs and power enlistment and public interest."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form.jpg",
      alt: "Screenshot of the Payment Request Form on the My.AmeriCorps.gov site, with a more formidable and bureaucratic voice.",
      caption: "My.AmeriCorps.gov: Take note of the comparatively institutional voice."
    }
  ]}
  aspectRatio={"9 / 16"}
/>

The voice of AmeriCorps.gov, in comparison to MyAmeriCorps.gov, has a quality of
actionable, mission-oriented neighborliness to it. It's designed to consistently
showcase the organization's services and values throughout the experience. This
deliberate consistency aids in creating a memorable impression of the brand, so 
audiences associate the AmeriCorps imagery with a particular voice and a certain
mission.

The internal voice we find in My.AmeriCorps.gov, on the other hand, is more precise, orderly, and
professional. It contains a lexicon of acronyms, jargon, and ideas that structures
the program itself, and approachability isn't as much of a priority as it is for
the public-facing AmeriCorps.gov.

This dichotomy has a function: The regimented language in My.AmeriCorps.gov is
intended to dispell ambiguity and nurtures accountability within AmeriCorps.
This is to maintain internal order and minimize risk to the organization's 
funding whenever the matter comes up in Congress.

### Designing a voice chart

With respect to keeping this dichotomy, while reducing the verbosity of
bureaucratic language in MyAmeriCorps.gov and importing the functional,
mission-focused elements of AmeriCorps.gov's voice, I identified two voices for
the portal: the **Unified Mission** and **Community Corps** voices.

I drafted a voice chart to codify these voices to make their comprehension and
implementation easy for content writers:

<table class="text-small">
  <tr>
    <th>
    </th>
    <th>
      Unified Mission
    </th>
    <th>
      Community Corps
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Concepts
    </th>
    <td>
      AmeriCorps *celebrates and welcomes serving* our country's diverse
      communities and needs.
    </td>
    <td>
      AmeriCorps carries the U.S. government's brand of professional *respect,
      efficacy, precision, orderliness, and cooperation.*
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Vocabulary
    </th>
    <td>
      Service, communities, opportunities, impact, families, benefits,
      education, support, provide, assist.
    </td>
    <td>
      Mitigation, response, recovery, stewardship, leadership, training, spike,
      capacity, + internally-exclusive jargon and acronyms.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Verbosity
    </th>
    <td>
      Concise & approachable: *Optimistic.*
    </td>
    <td>
      Precise & professional: *Resilient.*
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Grammar
    </th>
    <td>
      Directive. Passive, as if from third-person outside assessment, when
      describing AmeriCorps and the activities of AmeriCorps.
    </td>
    <td>
      Directive.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Punctuation
    </th>
    <td>
      Ends sentences & phrases with periods.
    </td>
    <td>
      Ends sentences & phrases with periods.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="text-align-left">
      Capitalization
    </th>
    <td>
      Sentence case.
      Title case buttons & titles.
    </td>
    <td>
      Sentence case.
      Title case buttons & titles.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

These two voices are designed to make writing a stylistically consistent,
functionally branded experience possible across a team of content writers.
Following these guidelines would create a coherent and recognizable 'voice' for
My.AmeriCorps.gov. Each of the two voices has a purpose:

#### Community Corps - The internal voice of order

The more interally-focused *Community Corps* voice values precision and
professionalism. It exists to project order, respect, and efficacy amongst those
already working within AmeriCorps.

The current content of MyAmeriCorps.gov, while self-serious, currently lacks
concision, and this lack of concision inadvertently communicates a lack of order
and efficacy. The dense legal text and sometimes verbose strings risk confusion
and speaks to users as a lawyer might. 

By imprementing the Community Corps voice
and conciously adhering to its focus on precision, writers can create concise
and relevant portal content that doesn't exclude users with advanced vocabulary,
content irrelevant to tasks being performed, or demand unnecessary focus to
understand.

#### Unified Mission - United in mission

The *Unified Mission* voice takes cues from AmeriCorps.gov's content and
AmeriCorps PR material; it can be used on the portal to drive engagement and the
conversion of non-profit sponsors and potential corps members.

The current voice of My.AmeriCorps.gov is distinct from that of AmeriCorps.gov;
this lack of cohesion may be jarring for users. There's a great opportunity to
advance brand consistency and leverage the approachability, mission focused, and
values-oriented qualities of the rest of the AmeriCorps image on
My.AmeriCorps.gov by blending in the Unified Mission voice when appropriate.
Specifically, when users first register accounts and are exploring the
possibility of joining the program or applying for grants for their non-profits.

## Afterthoughts

The Plain Writing Act of 2010[^2] mandates that US government documents issued to
the public be written in clear and accessible languageâ€”plain writing. I suspect
that the content of My.AmeriCorps.gov is covered by this bill, and AmeriCorps
issues an occasional report on their adherence to federal plain language
guidelines.[^3]

Specifically, the content of My.AmeriCorps.gov is in electronic form, is issued by 
a federal agency (Corporation for National and Community Service), and has
writing that:

1. is necessary for obtaining federal government benefits and services, as well
   as filing taxes,
2. provides information about federal government benefits and services,
3. explains to the public how to comply with requirements that the federal
   government administers or enforces,
4. includes letters, forms, publications, notices, and instructions.

My.AmeriCorps.gov isn't included in AmeriCorps' April 2012 compliance report,[^4]
but other CNCS sites with up to 54,000 users are. I could be wrong: Maybe
My.AmeriCorps.gov isn't considered publicly accessible because it requires 
users to register an account.

In the spirit of the Plain Writing Act, though, the content of My.AmeriCorps.gov
could be realigned to match the accessibility and voice of the rest of the agency's
publications and web presence. Rustic UI of the experience aside, 
My.AmeriCorps.gov's content may be opaque enough to be deterring enlistment.

There's a good amount of federal and state institutions that could use a UX 
content touch-up. In my *Foundations of UX Writing* certificate class we used
[Indiana's BMV](https://mybmv.bmv.in.gov/bmv/mybmv/default.aspx) as a case-study:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/in-bmv.png"
  alt="Indiana's BMV page."
/>

We interact with these organizations on a semi-regular basis to access the sort
of basic services governments are formed to provide, and the UX of social media,
streaming, shopping, and video games in the private sector is comparatively 
sharp. They're no profit-drivers, but if we took care to make these institutional
experiences nearly as accessible and intuitive it could drive greater civic
engagement, strengthen the missions of programs and departments like AmeriCorps,
facilitate efficient governance, and improve lives.
