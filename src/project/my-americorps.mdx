<a href="https://americorps.gov/" target="_blank">AmeriCorps</a> is the largest
grant-maker in the United States. The organization's projects range from
disaster response to matters of economic opportunity, environmental stewardship,
and education.

The awesome mission of AmeriCorps would be better
served with a portal made usable through **accessible**, **clear**, **concise**,
**conventional**, and **purposeful** UX content that advances the AmeriCorps
voice and turns ladened
<a href="https://my.americorps.gov" target="_blank">My.AmeriCorps.gov</a> users
into *satisfied advocates of the program.*

## What is My AmeriCorps?

*My.AmeriCorps.gov* is the online nexus of the AmeriCorps operation.

Corps members, prospective corps members, team & unit leaders, staff, alumni, 
and non-profit sponsors all cross paths with the portal.

As an AmeriCorps alum I can attest that my unit regarded My.AmeriCorps.gov with
puzzled dread in the best of moments and frustration at worst. Here's a quick
tour:

    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "My AmeriCorps log in page: depicted on a 1920x1080 screen. If you're curious about the mysterious white space on the right: The site is 782px acrossâ€”always."

## User journey: Alum Alan

**Alum Alan** is an AmeriCorps alum who wants to access the Segal Education
Award granted upon completion of his service to pay for some of his college
tuition.

In user story terms:

> *As an...* AmeriCorps alum 

> *I want to...* disburse my Segal education award 

> *So I can...* pay for educational expenses at a qualified institution.

I examined the My.AmeriCorps.gov experience from the eyes of Alum Alan on his
journey to education award disbursal.

## Evaluating content usability

### 1. Heuristic evaluation

First I assessed the portal's UX content usability by performing a **heuristic
evaluation** on each page accessed along Alum Alan's journey.

For every string with an opportunity to improve on my usability criteria, I
dropped a flag and left a note.

I found quite a few:

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/login-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps log in page."
/>

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/home-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps alum landing page."
/>

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps form to request Segal Award disbursal."
/>

Alan's journey on MyAmeriCorps.gov scored a modest 30.8% usability on my **UX
writing scorecard**:

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/ux-content-usability-scorecard.png"
  alt="A scorecard evaluating the current usability of My AmeriCorps' UX content."
  display="protruding"
/>

Great! Now we know precisely where there's points for improvement.

As a proof-of-concept, I drafted an improved log in page with writing that
fulfills the usability criteria and resolves the issues I documented:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised.jpg",
      alt: "My AmeriCorps log in page with revised UX content.",
      caption: "Revised log in page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised-tos-clicked.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the terms of service is selected.",
      caption: "Terms of service pop-up."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised-privacy-statement-clicked.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the privacy statement is selected.",
      caption: "Privacy statement pop-up."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "Original log in page, pre-revisions."
    }
  ]}
/>

My enhancing revisions of UX content include:

* Sectioned & labeled *'Apply to Serve' block* to stimulate AmeriCorps
  applications,
* Legalese in the form of *optionally clickable tooltips* rather than a heavy
  chunk of text anchoring the page and acting as a focal point,
* *Verb-first* buttons,
* Buttons with a `<= 3` word maximum,
* *Concision:* Irrelevant and redundant strings removed.

### 2. Narrative arc

Next I mapped the **narrative arc** of Alan's experience in order to analyze the
user journey with greater granularity. This technique of 'narrative arc' is
similar to the diagrammatic
[journey mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) 
found in UX design, but it's more fitted to evaluating UX content:

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/current-journey.jpg"
  alt="Map of the current My AmeriCorps journey to Segal Award disbursal."
  display="protruding"
  caption="The current journey to Segal Award disbursal as ventured by persona Alum Alan."
/>

Through this practice of mapping I discovered more pain-points across the alum's
journey, inspiring these improvements to the 'Request Education Award
Payment' screen:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-revised.jpg",
      alt: "My AmeriCorps log in page with revised UX content.",
      caption: "After refining the UX content: Context-specific tooltips, prioritized concision, purposeful and accessible text, and legal disclaimers displaying only when relevant."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-revised-submit.jpg",
      alt: "Revised My AmeriCorps log in page when the terms of service is selected.",
      caption: "Legal disclaimer displayed as a pop-up as a final step when the user finally clicks 'Submit.'"
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form.jpg",
      alt: "Original 'Request Education Award Payment' page, pre-revisions.",
      caption: "Original 'Request Education Award Payment' page, pre-revisions: UI buttons hidden as labels, a lot of legal text, college-level vocabulary, and help buttons hyperlinked to unnavigable and out-of-date documentation."
    }
  ]}
/>
