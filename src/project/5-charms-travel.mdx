***Home page*** *improvements:*

* Prominent and consistent *calls-to-action.*
* *Distinctive branding and visual design,* improving ease-of-use through
  consistency, usage through novelty, and evoking the headspace of travel,
  opportunity, relaxation, optimism, and adventure.
* *Sorting of content in order of importance and relevance to users,* with 
  adventures at the very top.
* *Adventures carousel,* highlighting the suite of customizable adventures 
  proferred for users to explore and consider.
* *Testimonials,* showcasing the experiences of happy clients.
* *Consistent IxD grammar,* reducing cognitive load.
* *Skeumorphic fun:* Instant-film photographs and dog-eared sticky-notes, 
  creating a sense of memorable tangibility.
* *Generally adventure-focused above-the-fold header image,* in order to cater 
  to a wide demographic (non-Disney-specific).

### Forms 

The purpose of `5charmstravel.com` is to drive conversions and

    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/5-charms-travel/book-new-5.jpg"
    }
  ]}
/>

***Form*** *improvements:*

* *Progressive disclosure:* The UX principle of *progressive disclosure* is used
  to reduce fatigue and form bounce rates. By dividing the *Book Adventure* form 
  into five distinct and labeled steps, users are propelled by a sense of
  accomplishment with each successive 'section' completed.
* *Conditional logic:* Depending on the adventures selected, the form adjusts to
  collect relevant details. Say you're going to Disneyland: the new *Book
  Adventure* form will collect Disneyland-specific
  preferences with regards to accommodations and activities.
* *Recognition > recall:* Adventures options are represented with the same
  images and labels as they are elsewhere on the site, minimizing the effort of
  identification and selection.
* *Zero redundancy:* The original site had `3` forms, all with the same purpose;
  the redesign has `1`, which every call-to-action points towards.

### Blog

    }

***Blog*** *improvements:*

* *Blog post → adventure associations:* Allowing users to filter blog posts to 
  read about the adventures they find most compelling.
* *Persistent newsletter sign-up call-to-action,* in service of marketing and 
  maintaining brand visibility.
* *Related blog posts* posted at the bottom of each post improves low funnel
  marketing, suggesting further posts for users interested in specific
  adventures and similar content.

## Development

### Backend

The original `5charmstravel.com` was a WordPress site designed by 
[GoDaddy design services](https://www.godaddy.com/studio) and hosted on 
`GoDaddy.com`.

I decided to rebuild the site with a headless CMS:

* A good headless CMS is *easy for non-developers to use.* Content can be 
  effortlessly authored and updated by the client and their employees to fit
  business needs and the evolution of the market. Rapid changes are possible 
  without the intervention of a web developer.
* A headless CMS decouples the content from WordPress' schemas and the plugins
  required to fit it into reusable components, optimizing *ease-of-maintenance:*
  There's no plugins to update or keep an eye on for stagnant
  development.
* Pulling content from a headless CMS to a static site frontend *reduces
  vulnerability 'surface area.'*
* A headless CMS makes establishing relationships between content (say, a
  *blog post → adventure*, and *testimonial → adventure*) possible via a 
  relational database.

### Frontend

I built the frontend using [Astro](https://astro.build) and
[SolidJS](https://solidjs.com).

Both were chosen for close-to-raw-JavaScript speed, since the site is
graphically 'heavy' with high-res pictures, and the longer it takes a page to 
load, the greater the bounce rate and the worse the search engine rankings.

Astro is perfect for static sites, as the developer experience is similar to 
popular reactive frameworks, but it's geared towards building static multi-page 
applications instead of SPAs. 

A SPA wouldn't be appropriate for
`5charmstravel.com`, as the site uses blog posts and content to draw traffic,
and a virtual DOM wouldn't be so awesome for that. Well-structured, plain HTML
is better for SEO.
