I developed Noonoo Design Language for this website and as a brand
identity.

Let's get right into it!

## Conceptual influences

Noonoo Design draws from the school of
[neumorphism](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/what-is-neumorphism), a design trend from
around 2020 that acts as a visual midway between pre-2010s
[skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism) and minimalist
flat design. Neumorphism constructs UIs that look more 'tangible' and
'realistic' while avoiding the visual noise and complexity of skeumorphism.
Shadows are used to illustrate depth and a 3D-like effect, with elements
pressed into or protruding from the interface.

As you might imagine by the heavy use of shadows and near-skeumorphic design,
I drew inspiration from a lot of (personally) nostalgic sources. I wanted to
create a somewhat modernized 'sequel' to the
[frutiger aero](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/58103/1/what-is-frutiger-aero-aesthetic-tiktok-msn-messenger-windows-vista-noughties)
era while eschewing flat design and
[Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis);
not out of lack of appreciation for these styles, but because creating a
portfolio's a great opportunity to construct a distinctive identity out of 
personally resonant sources.

Here's the mood board:

It's a seemingly disparate blend of ideas, but there's some key commonalities
and features that I've borrowed:

* *Rounded, organic shapes with smooth, curved lines* - To gently guide focus
  along the interface like the carpets of a casino[^1] and to conjure the
  human affinity for curved shapes originating from our pre-90° angle past.
* *Symbiosis between nature and artifice* - Intended to balance the 'techy'
  look & feel of the language and offer some reprieve from the digital
  claustrophobia of an always-online world.
* *Wide, plains-like white space* - To create a less busy / cluttered
  interface, minimizing cognitive load and leveraging the savanna principle.
* *Utilitarianism* - Artifacts like Wikipedia, monorails,
  airplanes, OS X, and brutalist architecture all have a tool-like
  utility at their core that makes for efficient and satisfying experiences.
* *Red as focus conductor* - Mario, Home

## Design principles 

The guiding principles of Noonoo are ***THUSS***:

* ***T**actility:* Noonoo uses neumorphism's tactile traits to
    * *Interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile interaction. `Ex:
      Buttons protrude from and depress into the interface like real buttons,
      and cards float above the interface to evoke layering and depth.`
    * *Non-interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile artifacts. `Ex:
      Block quotes and certain images are 'pressed' into the interface.`
* ***H**ospitality:*
    * *Tactility* is used to simulate a familiar experience interacting with
      tangible high-tech tools such as clocks, phones, machines, and
      synthesizers. This is in contrast to designs that more closely
      mimic print or take advantage of preexisting familiarity with digital
      experiences.
    * *Rounded shapes* are used to evoke approachability and friendliness.
    * *
* ***U**sability:*
    * *Click boxes* are substantial and accessible. This is a lucky
      side-effect of neumorphic objects being relatively 'large' owing to the
      shadows required for the tactile visual effect to work.
    * *Typography* is minimally sophisticated with clear information
      architecture to fortify legibility. Individual characters are
      distinguishable from each other: 0s have slashes and 'l' is clearly not
      'I.' `Monospaced code` is just as readable and its handwriting-like
      qualities have an affable organicism to it.
* ***S**implicity:* 
    * *Components* are minimally complex; their use should be obvious.
    * *Colors* are relatively neutral so as to better showcase
      designs with other color schemes and design languages, as well as photos
      and illustrations.
* ***S**pectacle:* Noonoo has a distinguishable and memorable identity.

## What's in a name?

I call it "Noonoo" because:

1. That [sentient vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLYCHR-VehQ) from
   *Teletubbies* is called "Noo-Noo," and man, was that a wonderfully bizarre
   fever dream of a show.
2. *Noonoo*'s a fun, light-hearted bisyllabic name that fits the 
   [quintessential Filipino nickname format](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/filipino-names-and-nicknames-1.6074647).
3. *Neumorphism* → *Neuneumorphism* → *Neuneu* → *Noonoo*

## Colors

### Color Palette

#### Tahoma White

  alt="Tahoma White color palette."

/>

* *Namesake:* Mt. Rainier / Tahoma
* *Role:* Primary

Tahoma White has a hint of red to it for a couple reasons:
1. The neumorphic effect doesn't quite work in grayscale; an off-white works
   better.
2. Since white is the base color of my interface I decided to lean more towards
   the warmer spectrum of color to minimize eye strain.

#### Lawetlat'la Ash 

<NNImage

/>

* *Namesake:* Mt. St. Helens / Lawetlet'la
* *Role:* Primary

*Lawetlet'la Ash* has slightly more green and blue than red, making it a good 
compliment to Tahoma White.

#### Spectacular Red 

<NNImage

* *Role:* Main accent

*Spectacular Red* is the main accent color of Noonoo Design, chosen for its
bright, electric hue. 

#### Rain City Emerald

#### Whulge Blue

*Namesake:* Puget Sound / Whulge

### Dark Mode / Light Mode

I'm working on a dark mode color scheme as well:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/noonoo-design-language/dark-mode.jpg",
      alt: "Noonoo Design Language in dark mode."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/noonoo-design-language/light-mode.jpg",
      alt: "Noonoo Design Language in light mode."
    }
  ]}
/>

The dark / light theme swap is more of a nice-to-have feature; I plan to add it
to the site in the future.

## Interactive Noonoo examples

  code={
`// Intermittent reminder to hack the Gibson.
const randomInterval = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * (5000 - 1000 + 1) 
  + 1000);
const message = () => console.log("We gotta hack the Gibson!");
setInterval(message, randomInterval());
`}
/>

## Why neumorphism?

I've come across numerous *Medium* thinkpieces and YouTube video essays
purporting that neumorphism is inherently inaccessible; that the visual style
is sub-optimally usable.

I'd argue that this is a bit of a catchy myth.

A green field UX design begins with wireframes; basic, grayscale wireframes
without personality or branding. Through a process of iteration and refinement,
a designer's goal is to reach a point where these anonymous wireframes are accessible and
speak to the function of the interface. They should be usable, even in black &
white or sketched out on paper.

This would be done by (among all sorts of other techniques) designing wireframes with Gestalt principles in mind,
leveraging perceptual patterns and/or interaction grammar to place and design components, using a logical 
information architecture, minimizing cognitive load, and testing whether the
design 'stands straight' as far as desired user experience and product indicators.

Because of this, adding a visual treatment like neumorphic design to your interface shouldn't 
lessen the proven usability of your wireframes so long as the final design adheres to the
same basic visual grammar of the frames and accessibility standards like 
[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)—and that's still possible with neumorphic
design.

I think, though, that there's a greater risk of creating less accessible
neumorphic designs if the designer skips wireframing and builds something 
'from' visual design with the main intention of making it look aesthetically
awesome.

In comparison, a flat, minimal design is less risky because the lack of visual
chrome naturally leads designers to focus on what's remaining—usability and functionality;
there's less mental overhead. 

Neumorphism's traits don't present much risk to usability in our case since I'll
be using Noonoo Design for a fairly basic, paper-like interface consisting of
cards, buttons, forms, images and simple components. If, instead, this were a
richly interactive mobile app or something as jam-packed with functionality as a
DAW or NLE, then creating a fitting neumorphic design language could be a whole
lot more challenging.
