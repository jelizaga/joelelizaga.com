## Noonoo: The concept

### Principles 

The guiding principles of Noonoo are ***THUSS***:

* ***T**actility:* Noonoo uses neumorphism's tactile traits to
    * *Interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile interaction. `Ex:
      Buttons protrude from and depress into the interface like real buttons,
      and cards float above the interface to evoke layering and depth.`
    * *Non-interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile artifacts. `Ex:
      Block quotes and certain images are 'pressed' into the interface.`
* ***H**ospitality:*
    * *Tactility* is used to simulate a familiar experience interacting with
      tangible high-tech tools such as clocks, phones, machines, and
      synthesizers. This is in contrast to designs that more closely
      mimic print or take advantage of preexisting familiarity with digital
      experiences.
    * *Rounded shapes* are used to evoke approachability and friendliness.
* ***U**sability:*
    * *Click boxes* are substantial and accessible. This is a lucky
      side-effect of neumorphic objects being relatively 'large' owing to the
      shadows required for the tactile effect to work.
    * *Typography* is minimally sophisticated with clear information
      architecture to fortify legibility. Individual characters are
      distinguishable from each other: 0s have slashes and 'l' is clearly not
      'I.' `Monospaced code` is just as readable and its handwriting-like
      qualities have a friendly organicism to it.
* ***S**implicity:* 
    * *Colors* are relatively neutral so as to better showcase
      designs with other color schemes and design languages, as well as photos
      and illustrations.
* ***S**pectacle:* Noonoo has a distinguishable and memorable identity.

I call it "Noonoo" because:

1. That [sentient vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLYCHR-VehQ) from
   *Teletubbies* is called "Noo-Noo," and man, was that a wonderfully bizarre
   fever dream of a show.
2. *Noonoo*'s a fun, light-hearted bisyllabic name that fits the 
   [quintessential Filipino nickname format](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/filipino-names-and-nicknames-1.6074647).
3. *Neumorphism* → *Neuneumorphism* → *Neuneu* → *Noonoo*

## Noonoo: What? *Why?*

Around 2020 

I've come across numerous *Medium* thinkpieces and YouTube video essays
purporting that neumorphism is inherently inaccessible; that the visual style
is sub-optimally usable.

I'd argue that this is a bit of a catchy myth.

A green field UX design begins with wireframes; basic, grayscale wireframes
without personality or branding. Through a process of iteration and refinement,
a designer's goal is to reach a point where these anonymous wireframes are accessible and
speak to the function of the interface. They should be usable, even in black &
white or sketched out on paper.

This would be done by (among all sorts of other techniques) designing wireframes with Gestalt principles in mind,
leveraging perceptual patterns and/or interaction grammar to place and design components, using a logical 
information architecture, minimizing cognitive load, and testing whether the
design 'stands straight' as far as desired user experience and product indicators.

Because of this, adding a visual treatment like neumorphic design to your interface shouldn't 
lessen the proven usability of your wireframes so long as the final design adheres to the
same basic visual grammar of the frames and accessibility standards like 
[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)—and that's still possible with neumorphic
design.

I think, though, that there's a greater risk of creating less accessible
neumorphic designs if the designer skips wireframing and builds something 
'from' visual design with the main intention of making it look aesthetically
awesome.

In comparison, a flat, minimal design is less risky because the lack of visual
chrome naturally leads designers to focus on what's remaining—usability and functionality;
there's less mental overhead.
