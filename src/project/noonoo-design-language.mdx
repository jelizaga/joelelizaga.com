Experience the future with ***Noonoo Design:*** *High-tech utopianism that you 
can (almost) feel!* ❋

Developed for my website, resume, and other contingencies, Noonoo Design blends
neumorphism with a harmony between techno-artifice and organicism to be bright,
friendly, functional, and optimistic; a design-space that reminds us that the
technologies we create can be great.

## Conceptual influences

Noonoo Design draws from the school of
[neumorphism](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/what-is-neumorphism), a design trend from
around 2020 that acts as a visual midway between pre-2010s
[skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism) and minimalist
flat design. Neumorphism constructs UIs that look more 'tangible' and
'realistic' while avoiding the visual noise and complexity of skeumorphism.
Light and shadow are used to create depth and a 3D-like effect, with elements
pressed into or protruding from the interface.

As you might imagine by the heavy use of shadows and near-skeumorphic design,
I drew inspiration from a lot of (personally) nostalgic sources. I wanted to
create a somewhat modernized 'sequel' to the bright blue optimism of the
[frutiger aero](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/58103/1/what-is-frutiger-aero-aesthetic-tiktok-msn-messenger-windows-vista-noughties)
era while eschewing flat design and
[Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis);
not out of lack of appreciation for Memphis, but because creating a
portfolio's a great opportunity to construct a distinctive identity out of 
personally resonant sources:

Here's the mood board:

*Noonoo; where neumorphism meets nostalgia!*

It's a seemingly disparate blend of ideas, but there's some key commonalities
and features that I've borrowed:

* *Rounded, organic shapes with smooth, curved lines* - To gently guide focus
  along the interface like the carpets of a casino[^1] and to conjure the
  human affinity for curved shapes originating from our pre-90° angle past.
* *Symbiosis between nature and artifice* - Intended to balance the 'techy'
  look & feel of the language and offer some reprieve from the digital
  claustrophobia of an always-online world.
* *Wide, plains-like white space* - To create a less busy / cluttered
  interface, minimizing cognitive load and leveraging the savanna principle.
* *Utilitarianism* - Artifacts like Wikipedia, monorails,
  airplanes, OS X, and brutalist architecture all have a functionality-first,
  tool-centric utility at their core that makes for efficient and satisfying 
  experiences.
* *Red as focus conductor* - The (relatively) more numerous low-frequency cones 
  in our retinas pick up the wide gamut of red wavelengths; because of this,
  red is an eye-catching and memorable color.

## Design principles 

The guiding principles of Noonoo are ***THUSS***:

* ***T**actility:* Noonoo uses neumorphism's tactile traits to construct a UI
  that feels like a tangible and immersive experience, communicating
  function through form.
    * *Interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile interaction. `Ex:
      Buttons protrude from and depress into the interface like real buttons,
      and cards float above the interface to evoke layering and depth.`
    * *Non-interactive objects* are shaped to suggest tactile artifacts. `Ex:
      Block quotes and certain images are 'pressed' into the interface.`
* ***H**ospitality:* Noonoo is approachable; "user friendly" in both aesthetic
  and utility.
    * *Tactility* is used to simulate a familiar experience interacting with
      tangible high-tech tools such as clocks, phones, machines, and
      synthesizers. This is in contrast to designs that more closely
      mimic print or take advantage of preexisting familiarity with digital
      experiences.
    * *Rounded shapes* are used to evoke approachability and friendliness.
* ***U**sability:* Noonoo prioritizes usability, ensuring that its interfaces
  and artifacts can be traversed with ease.
    * *Click boxes* are substantial and accessible. This is a lucky
      side-effect of neumorphic objects being relatively 'large' owing to the
      shadows required for the tactile visual effect to work.
    * *Typography* is minimally sophisticated with clear information
      architecture to fortify legibility. Individual characters are
      distinguishable from each other: 0s have slashes and 'l' is clearly not
      'I.' `Monospaced code` is just as readable and its handwriting-like
      qualities have an affable organicism to it.
* ***S**implicity:* Noonoo eschews the visual complexity of skeumorphism while
  retaining its strengths, and borrows from flat design's function-first
  philosophy.
    * *Components* are minimally complex; their use should be obvious.
    * *Colors* are relatively neutral so as to better showcase
      designs with other color schemes and design languages, as well as photos
      and illustrations.
* ***S**pectacle:* Noonoo is designed to be immediately distinguishable at a
  glance so as to be memorable; this is partially thanks to its roots in an 
  unconventional design paradigm (neumorphism) and pseudo-anachronistic 
  tactility.

***THUSS*** aren't standalone 'columns' buttressing the structure of Noonoo all
on their own; there's a lot of conceptual overlap and mutual reinforcement. For 
example, *tactility* reinforces *hospitality* and *usability;* *simplicity*
reinforces *usability* too. ***T***, ***H***, ***U***, ***S***, and ***S*** are
all interdependent.

Think of the principles as many pentagonal plates shaping a geodesic dome.

## What's in a name?

I call it "Noonoo" because:

1. *Neumorphism* → *Neuneumorphism* → *Neuneu* → *Noonoo*
2. *Noonoo*'s a fun, light-hearted bisyllabic name that fits the 
   [quintessential Filipino nickname format](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/filipino-names-and-nicknames-1.6074647),
   and its whimsy embodies the utopic essence of the design language.
3. That [sentient vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLYCHR-VehQ) from
   *Teletubbies* is called "Noo-Noo," and man, was that a wonderfully bizarre
   fever dream of a show.

## Colors

### Color Palette

#### Tahoma White 

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/noonoo-design-language/tahoma-white.jpg"
  alt="Tahoma White color palette."
  caption="Photo by Caleb Riston @ Unsplash."
/>

* *Namesake:* Mt. Rainier / Tahoma
* *Role:* Primary

Tahoma White has the tiniest hint of red to it for a couple reasons:

1. The neumorphic effect doesn't quite 'work' in pure grayscale; an off-white
   like Tahoma White better simulates 'physicality' using the extra dimension of
   hue in addition to the spectrum of brightness that would be found between 
   plain black & white (grayscale).
2. Since white is the base color of my interface I decided to lean more towards
   the warmer spectrum of color in order to minimize eye strain and project a 
   'warm' experience.

#### Lawetlat'la Ash 

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/noonoo-design-language/lawetlatla-ash.jpg"
  alt="Lawetlat'a Ash color palette."
  caption="Photo by Brianna Tucker @ Unsplash."
/>

* *Namesake:* Mt. St. Helens / Lawetlet'la
* *Role:* Primary

*Lawetlet'la Ash* has slightly more green and blue than red, making it a good 
compliment to Tahoma White's warmth. 

The ashy grays make me think of a soft B-grade pencil.

#### Spectacular Red 

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/noonoo-design-language/spectacular-red.jpg"
  alt="Spectacular Red color palette."
/>

* *Role:* Main accent

*Spectacular Red* is the main accent color of Noonoo Design, chosen for its
bright, electric hue. I use it to direct attention and indicate interactivity;
"active" elements light up with Spectacular Red, inviting users to action.

Spectacular Red is intended to be evocative of a highly precise and competent
energy; something like a laser pointer, the innards of HAL-9000, or the glowing
eyes of robots from 1980s sci-fi action films.

#### Rain City Emerald

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/noonoo-design-language/rain-city-emerald.jpg"
  alt="Rain City Emerald color palette."
/>

* *Namesake:* City of Seattle
* *Role:* Secondary accent

With our main accent color out of the way, I finished off the palette with two
more complementary accents; a green and a blue, as a salute to the red, green,
and blue LEDs that comprise modern-day monitors and construct the spectrum of
color we see on our screens through their many possible permutations.

Rain City Emerald just happened to look good juxtaposed with Spectacular Red,
Tahoma White, and Lawetlat'la Ash.

#### Whulge Blue
   
<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/noonoo-design-language/whulge-blue.jpg"
  alt="Whulge Blue color palette."
/>

* *Namesake:* Puget Sound / Whulge
* *Role:* Secondary accent

Like Rain City Emerald, Whulge Blue serves to 'round out' Noonoo's color
palette. If I were to leave it at just Spectacular Red and Emerald City Green 
we'd have a bit of a Christmas-color cliché situation, and the addition of
Whulge Blue leaves the door open for tertiary colors that could be used to
further distinguish and categorize elements.

Whulge Blue also allows a playful (but not derivative) homage to
[Aqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_%28user_interface%29)'s iconic
window decoration "traffic lights":

<Code
  filename="hack_the_gibson.js"
  lang="js"
  code={
`// Intermittent reminder to hack the Gibson.
const randomInterval = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * (5000 - 1000 + 1) 
  + 1000);
const reminder = () => console.log("We gotta hack the Gibson!");
setInterval(reminder, randomInterval());
`}
/>

### Dark Mode / Light Mode

I'm working on a dark mode color scheme as well:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/noonoo-design-language/dark-mode.jpg",
      alt: "Noonoo Design Language in dark mode."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/noonoo-design-language/light-mode.jpg",
      alt: "Noonoo Design Language in light mode."
    }
  ]}
/>

The dark / light theme swap is more of a nice-to-have feature; I plan to add it
to the site in the future.

## Logo: The Octostar

<NNImage
  src="/img/octostar/octostar-spectacular-red.svg"
  alt="The octostar logo."
  display="flat"
  float="right"
  popup={false}
  transparentBackground={true}
/>

The Octostar (❋) is an asterisk / star glyph consisting of eight teardrop-like
spokes.

The Octostar's symbolism, shape, and history make it *particularly well-fitted
to represent my practice*:

### Symbolism

* **Focus** - Asterisks are used in writing to denote edits;
  *tactical diversions of attention and detours to edification.* A designer is
  mindful of the foci of their users, stakeholders, and the product itself. The
  decisions a designer makes and the patterns they apply are informed by
  knowledge, logic, and qualifications that could be seemingly called out by a
  traditional asterisk in a text—an unobtrusive option to follow their reasoning
  if necessary.
* **Fusion** - Stars are used as
  [wildcard characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character) in
  software development; *to capture 'anything' and 'everything.'* Say
  you'd like to delete everything in your file system; using a wildcard, that's
  `sudo rm -rf / *`. We draw from diverse sources, experiences, collaborators,
  skills, inspirations, ideas, and fields to engineer and design quality experiences.
  This inquisitive interfusion is not unlike the fully-inclusive dragnet of
  wildcards.
* **Growth** - Asterisks are used as multiplication operators in
  math, symbolizing *growth through duplication, iteration, and repetition.* In 
  UX we use iteration to find our way to optimal designs, features, and
  concepts: Each iteration of a design is an evolution of a previous iteration. 
  Under a different light, iteration can also be understood as a form of 
  practice; a method of 'growing' skill through repetition—something that 
  applies to any kind of labor; motor skills, creativity, social finesse, or 
  knowledge work.
* **Computing** - This one's straightforward; there's `8` bits to a byte! ☻

### Shape

❋ shares the curved lines used elsewhere in Noonoo Design. Its symmetry, heavy
weight, and simplicity make it recognizable from a distance and easy to draw on
paper, which is about all one can ask for from a logo.

Stars have six spokes in the majority of fonts (like ＊—check your own * key), 
but most writers will draw their stars with eight spokes when writing by hand 
because it's easier to make out a neatly symmetrical character with eight.
I'd like to think that the eight-spoked star has a dash of extra humanism 
because of this.

### History

❋ was [added to Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2700.pdf) in 1991
as part of the
[ITC Zap Dingbats typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats) along
with a handful of other asterisk-like decorations and stars. I think taking a 
logo right out of Unicode is pretty fitting; the ease with which I can print the
plain Unicode glyph onto virtually anything speaks to its **u**sability and 
**s**implicity.

Despite the glyph's institutional roots, I've noticed a 'chip' in the 
spoke at the 10:30 o'clock mark that I'd like to correct when I modify the glyph
to use as a logo.

I think that chip adds a little character, though; a humanist hint of mortality.

## Why neumorphism?

I've come across numerous thinkpieces and YouTube video essays
purporting that neumorphism is inherently inaccessible; that the visual style
is sub-optimally usable.

I think this is a bit of a myth:

A green field UX design begins with wireframes; basic, grayscale wireframes
without personality or branding. Through a process of iteration and refinement,
a designer's goal is to reach a point where these anonymous wireframes are accessible and
speak to the function of the interface. They should be usable, even in black &
white or sketched out on paper.

This would be done by (among all sorts of other techniques) designing wireframes with Gestalt principles in mind,
leveraging perceptual patterns and/or interaction grammar to locate and design components, using a logical 
information architecture, minimizing cognitive load, and testing whether the
design 'stands straight' as far as desired user experience and product indicators.

Because of this, adding a visual treatment like neumorphic design to your
interface *shouldn't* lessen the proven usability of your wireframes so long as 
the final design adheres to the same basic visual grammar of the frames and
accessibility standards like [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)—and that's 
still possible with neumorphic design.

I think, though, that there's a greater risk of creating less accessible
neumorphic designs if the designer skips wireframing and builds something 
'from' visual design with the main intention of making it look aesthetically
awesome.

In comparison, a flat, minimal design is less risky because the lack of visual
chrome naturally leads designers to focus on what's remaining—usability and functionality;
there's less mental overhead. 

Neumorphism's traits don't present much risk to usability in our case since I'll
be using Noonoo Design for a fairly basic, paper-like interface consisting of
cards, buttons, forms, images and simple components. If, instead, this were a
richly interactive mobile app or something as jam-packed with functionality as a
DAW or NLE, then creating a fitting neumorphic design language could be a whole
lot more challenging.

## Afterthoughts

This page is a living document; Noonoo Design isn't really 'done.' 

As I get more practice, visual trends evolve, tools develop, time passes by and 
I encounter the necessity I'm sure this iteration of Noonoo will look as dated 
as anything ever designed and warrant some mutation.

Let's hope it's later, rather than sooner, right?
