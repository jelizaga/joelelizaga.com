You're looking at Noonoo design language *right now!*

Noonoo is 

## Noonoo: The concept

* *Physicality:*
* *Simplicity:* 
* *Usability:*
* *Spectacle:*

I call it "Noonoo" because:

1. That [sentient vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLYCHR-VehQ) from
   *Teletubbies* is called "Noo-Noo," and man, was that a wonderfully bizarre
   fever dream of a show.
2. *Noonoo*'s a fun, light-hearted bisyllabic name that fits the 
   [classic Filipino nickname format](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/filipino-names-and-nicknames-1.6074647).
3. *Neumorphism* → *Neuneumorphism* → *Neuneu* → *Noonoo*
   

## Noonoo: What? *Why?*

Around 2020 

I've come across numerous *Medium* thinkpieces and YouTube video essays
purporting that neumorphism is inherently inaccessible; that the visual style
is sub-optimally usable.

I'd argue that this is a bit of a catchy myth.

A green field UX design begins with wireframes; basic, grayscale wireframes
without personality or branding. Through a process of iteration and refinement,
a designer's goal is to reach a point where these anonymous wireframes are accessible and
speak to the function of the interface. They should be usable, even in black &
white or sketched out on paper.

This would be done by (among all sorts of other techniques) designing wireframes with Gestalt principles in mind,
leveraging perceptual patterns and/or interaction grammar to place and design components, using a logical 
information architecture, minimizing cognitive load, and testing whether the
design 'stands straight' as far as desired user experience and product indicators.

Because of this, adding a visual treatment like neumorphic design to your interface shouldn't 
lessen the proven usability of your wireframes so long as the final design adheres to the
same basic visual grammar of the frames and accessibility standards like 
[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)—and that's still possible with neumorphic
design.

I think, though, that there's a greater risk of creating less accessible
neumorphic designs if the designer skips wireframing and builds something 
'from' visual design with the main intention of making it look aesthetically
awesome.

In comparison, a flat, minimal design is less risky because the lack of visual
chrome naturally leads designers to focus on what's remaining—usability and functionality;
there's less mental overhead.
