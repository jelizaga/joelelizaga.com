[`instally`](https://github.com/jelizaga/instally) is a portable interactive
CLI script for *conveniently & consistently installing packages en masse on
Linux,* featuring:

* üöö **JSON-driven flexibility:** Specify packages for `instally` to install using
  JSON, enjoying support for:
    * organizing packages in groups,
    * preferring methods of installation on a package-by-package basis,
    * fallback installation methods,
    * OS-specific installation methods,
    * ***9*** different package managers,
    * and even running your own installation commands!
* ‚õ∫ **Minimal dependencies:** Owing to `instally`'s simplicity, you can bring
  `instally` to any Linux distribution capable of running Bash and
  `jq`.
* üíº **Superb portability:** With `instally` and your own custom `package.json`
  file, you can bring your favorite packages to (almost) any distro and install
  them right away.

## User Experience

The UI guidelines we use today for heuristic analysis were coded during the
1960s and 70s for command-line interface programs: `instally` is a CLI script,
but I still used the same UX principles a designer would apply to, say, a
mobile app or a website.

### User & Use-Case

`instally`'s primary use-case is for the developer or Linux user (aficionado?) 
who is going to open their terminal upon installing their OS. This is 
because they're about to invoke `apt`, `dnf`, or `zypper` with a laundry list of 
packages to install.

With that in mind, installing and using `instally` is pretty trivial:

<Code
  lang="bash"
  code={
`# Download instally off GitHub, unarchive, and run instally:
wget -P ~/Downloads \\
  https://github.com/jelizaga/instally/archive/refs/tags/v0.23.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/v0.23.tar.gz
cd ~/Downloads/instally-0.23
./instally
`}
/>

Alternatively (and most effectively), `instally` makes a great `git` submodule 
or script in a [`dotfiles`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) repo. A 
distro-hopper on a fresh install will:

1. install `git` (if it's missing)
2. clone their `.dotfiles` repo (to import & symlink their configs)

If `instally` is already included in their `.dotfiles` along with a
`package.json`, all the user has to do is run `instally` to select their
packages for installation.

Given that `instally` supports 9 different package managers and OS-specific
installation methods, this process of installing their package environments is
made a whole lot easier: Users don't have to remember what packages to install, 
or even what package IDs to use for which package managers on particular 
operating systems.

Basically, we're leveraging **recognition** over **recall**.

### Recognition > Recall

For example, on Debian-based distros [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
can be installed like so:

<Code
  lang="bash"
  code={
`sudo apt install taskwarrior`
  }
/>

But on RHEL-based distros, this same application is installed with a different
ID (`task` instead of `taskwarrior`):

<Code
  lang="bash"
  code={
`sudo dnf install task`
  }/>

If the user recently switched from a Debian-based distro to Fedora, they'll be
running `sudo dnf install taskwarrior`, get a message from `dnf` saying, "No,
`taskwarrior` doesn't exist," and either try `sudo dnf install task` out of 
instinct or try searching `dnf` for the package‚Äîwhich is a bit of a waste of
cognition, especially if they're installing dozens (or hundreds) of packages
*just like this.* 

This is the inefficiency of **recall**; users drawing package IDs from 
fallible memory.

Using `instally`, we can avoid this inefficiency entirely:

<Code
  filename="package.json"
  lang="json"
  code={`{
  "name": "Taskwarrior",
  "description": "command-line todo list for staying on-task",
  "apt": {
    "id": "taskwarrior"
  },
  "dnf": {
    "id": "task"
  },
  "zypper": {
    "id": "taskwarrior"
  }
}`}/>

‚Üë Taskwarrior's the same app, but now we have three different installation
methods depending on whichever package manager's available.

Now all the user has to do is **recognize** Taskwarrior in `instally` and
select it for installation:

No memorization; no recall‚Äîusers know they'll be getting Taskwarrior without
fussing with package ID discrepencies and package managers.

### IxD Grammar

`instally` has a dense **IxD grammar**:

The *actions* (install, select, and edit) for `instally`'s *objects* are
consistent: this consistent vocabulary reduces possible cognitive load and
ambiguity, training a perceptual pattern with which the user learns to
navigate their `instally` experience: *`instally` is all about* ***selecting***
*and* ***installing,*** *and any object of `instally` is conceivably*
***editable.***

### Information Architecture

#### Colors

`instally` has three colors, each with their own function:

1. *Active color* - Highlights 'active' menu items and suggested keystrokes the
   user can perform.
2. *Accent color* - Partially decorative, but also used to embellish important
   information, such as the package report at the end of install runs.
3. *Selected color* - Used to denote menu items and selections made.

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/instally/centos-colors.jpg"
  alt="instally's three colors, prominently labeled."
  caption="The three colors vary from terminal to terminal, since they're set using ANSI codes so as to use the terminal's default color scheme."
/>

This simplicity and consistency makes `instally` easy to use.

#### Typography

Typography is used to make information scannable. For example, `instally` bolds
packages being installed, dependencies, and package managers (software) due to
their importance:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/instally/pop-typography-installation.jpg"
  alt="instally's customization menus."
/>

‚Üë Instructions and prompts are consistently italicized, whereas output and
`instally`'s operations are plain.

`instally`'s 'sections' are separated by a line break and each have a bolded 
and underlined heading, making it completely unambiguous where the user 'is'
and what's going on:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/instally/ubuntu-sections.jpg"
  alt="instally's customization menus."
/>


This creates a typographical 'language' that users can easily scan with
minimal focus.

#### Iconography

While installing packages, consistent, emoji-based iconography is used to 
further make information effortlessly scannable:

* üéÅ **-** Installed packages,
* üëç **-** *Already* installed packages,
* ‚ùó **-** Packages that could not be installed,
* ‚ùå **-** Missing (but expected) packages,
* ‚ùì **-** Ambiguously installed packages (shell commands with non-`0` exit codes),
* üåé **-** Installation in-progress,
* üëâ **-** Helpful tips (usually on resolving errors),
* ‚ú® **-** Updated package indices (`apt update`, for example),
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **-** Warnings (for user-defined shell commands being executed, for example),
* üìí **-** `package.json`,
* üêõ **-** Bugs & errors.

With a cursory glance down the left side of the terminal, a user can assess the
progress of their installation run:

<NNImage
  client:load
  src="/img/project/instally/opensuse-icons.jpg"
  alt="instally's iconography highlighted during an openSUSE installation run."
/>

If they'd like further detail, they can actually read the messages‚Äînot that it's 
necessary; the whole point of `instally` is to reduce mental investment
into the installation process.

## Background

This is going to get a bit in-the-weeds:

I wrote `instally` between 
[Pop!_OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop!_OS)
22.04 and System76's next LTS release, 
Pop!_OS 24.04, because there was a whole two years between 22.04 and 24.04
during which I anticipated making a clean reinstall of Pop! due to the projected 
addition of the new 
[COSMIC desktop environment](https://blog.system76.com/post/november-at-system76-products-promos--cosmic-de)
to Pop!_OS 24.04.

I didn't (and still don't‚Äî24.04 isn't out yet) know if COSMIC was going to be a 
polished enough experience to warrant using Pop!_OS 24.04, it being a new 
desktop environment and all, so `instally`'s my way of bringing my system to
whatever Linux distribution I ultimately end up using, Pop!_OS or not.

I chose to parse `package.json` with `jq` is because I wanted to learn how to 
use it and JSON lends itself handily to nesting data; the shape of 
`package.json` was self-evident from the get-go. I wanted to minimize 
`instally`'s dependencies, but I also didn't want to wrangle `awk` into being 
the thing reading the package file, because `awk` looked like it'd take much 
longer to grok than `jq` and asking ChatGPT to hold my hand through that one 
would feel like cheating.

## Afterthoughts

I learned a whole lot of Bash I wouldn't have otherwise known while
writing `instally`, and ultimately came to the conclusion that something much 
more polished could've been made in Python with a TUI library instead. Of
course, I'd have to call this hypothetical sequel to `instally` `installyy`.

The fact that it's in Bash really does make `instally` portable, though, and its
dependencies can all be grabbed as binaries. It's not a very economical script,
but it's no-fuss.

For all the UX principles used to design `instally`, I haven't user-tested it.
Like a lot of FOSS TUI stuff, its use-case is niche and I think it serves its 
purpose effectively enough to not warrant whittling it into something wholly
refined. If I'm going to do some serious testing, it'd have to be on something
with a larger user demographic and better incentives beyond sating personal
curiosity. 

That said, I think `instally` has its place, which is mostly in my `.dotfiles`
repo where I can set it and forget it while it installs a bunch of
packages and runs a few scripts whenever I make a clean install or spin a
virtual machine.
