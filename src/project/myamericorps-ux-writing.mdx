<a href="https://americorps.gov/" target="_blank">AmeriCorps</a> is the largest
grant-maker in the United States, and the organization's projects range from
disaster response to matters of economic opportunity, environmental stewardship,
and education.

AmeriCorps has an awesome mission, and naturally its mission would be better
served with a portal made usable through **accessible**, **clear**, **concise**,
**conventional**, and **purposeful** UX content that advances the AmeriCorps
voice and turns ladened
<a href="https://my.americorps.gov" target="_blank">MyAmeriCorps.gov</a> users
into *satisfied advocates of the program.*

### Analyzing the user's journey

Corps members, prospective corps members, staff, alumni, and non-profit sponsors
all cross paths with *MyAmeriCorps.gov*, AmeriCorps' singular web portal.

As an AmeriCorps alum I can attest that my unit regarded MyAmeriCorps.gov with
puzzled dread in the best of moments and frustration at worst:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/myamericorps-login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps login page.",
      caption: "My AmeriCorps log in page: depicted on a 1920x1080 screen. The site is 782px acrossâ€”always."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/myamericorps-home.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps landing page for alumni.",
      caption: "Corps member alum landing page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/myamericorps-payment-req.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps Segal Award payment request page.",
      caption: "Form used by alumni to request Segal Award payments."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/myamericorps-help.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps help documentation.",
      caption: "Site help documentation."
    }

  pay for educational expenses at a qualified institution.
