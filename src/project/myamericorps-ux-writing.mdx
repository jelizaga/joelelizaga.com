<a href="https://americorps.gov/" target="_blank">AmeriCorps</a> is the largest
grant-maker in the United States. The organization's projects range from
disaster response to matters of economic opportunity, environmental stewardship,
and education.

The awesome mission of AmeriCorps would be better
served with a portal made usable through **accessible**, **clear**, **concise**,
**conventional**, and **purposeful** UX content that advances the AmeriCorps
voice and turns ladened
<a href="https://my.americorps.gov" target="_blank">MyAmeriCorps.gov</a> users
into *satisfied advocates of the program.*

### Analyzing the user journey

Corps members, prospective corps members, staff, alumni, and non-profit sponsors
all cross paths with *MyAmeriCorps.gov*, the online nexus of AmeriCorps'
operation.

As an AmeriCorps alum I can attest that my unit regarded MyAmeriCorps.gov with
puzzled dread in the best of moments and frustration at worst. Here's a tour:

<NNCarousel
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/login.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps log in page.",
      caption: "My AmeriCorps log in page: depicted on a 1920x1080 screen. The site is 782px acrossâ€”always."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/home.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps landing page for alumni.",
      caption: "Corps member alum landing page."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/payment-req-form.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps Segal Award payment request page.",
      caption: "Form used by alumni to request Segal Award payments."
    },
    {
      src: "/img/project/my-americorps/help.jpg",
      alt: "The My AmeriCorps help documentation.",
      caption: "Site help documentation."
    }
  ]}
/>

> *As an* AmeriCorps alum *I want to* disburse my Segal education award *so I can*
  pay for educational expenses at a qualified institution.

/>

### Evaluating UX content

#### Usability

I assessed the portal's UX content usability by performing a **heuristic
evaluation** on each page along Alum Alan's journey.

For every string with an opportunity to improve on my usability criteria, I
dropped a flag and left a note.

I found quite a few:

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/login-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps log in page."
/>

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/home-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps alum landing page."
/>

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/payment-request-form-heuristic-evaluation.jpg"
  alt="Heuristic evaluation of the My AmeriCorps form to request Segal Award disbursal."
/>

Alan's journey on MyAmeriCorps.gov scored a modest 30.8% usability on my UX
writing scorecard:

  alt="A scorecard evaluating the current usability of My AmeriCorps' UX content."
  display="protruding"
/>

As a proof-of-concept, I drafted an improved log in page with writing that
fulfills the usability criteria and resolves the issues I documented:

<NNImage
  src="/img/project/my-americorps/login-revised.jpg"
  alt="My AmeriCorps log in page with revised UX content."
/>

Enhancing revisions of UX content include:

* Sectioned & labeled *'Apply to Serve' block* to stimulate AmeriCorps
  applications,
* Legalese in the form of *optionally clickable tooltips* rather than a heavy
  chunk of text anchoring the page,
* *Verb-first* buttons,
* Buttons with *< 3 words* maximum,
* *Concision:* Irrelevant strings removed.
