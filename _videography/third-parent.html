		<h2>
			A Technological Ethnography
		</h2>

		<p>
			I created <i>Third Parent</i> for a "self representation" project assigned by an
			experimental  media class I took at Evergreen. Thus far, I've finished half of the film.
			The completed half is a survey of the role information technology and video games played
			in my childhood, and how my parents' exposure to technology and their parent's exposure
			to technology had an impact on my own relationship to technology. What I've embedded is
			the complete first half; the second half is currently unfinished.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second half is to act as an antithesis to the first half. Throughout the first half
			(what I've embedded above) there's whimsical music, colorful visuals, and smiles all
			around as my parents reflect on their formative years with 1980's information technology
			and Space Invaders. Despite the cheery tone, there are ominous hints of insidiousness
			that are casually waved away with jubilant editing. The second half is intended to make
			due on these hints, the thesis being that with the endless convenience and entertainment
			yielded by technological evolution, there are tradeoffs. In essence, a significant
			portion of my generation was raised with a "third parent" (digital technology) and
			that it's up to us to use this experience to determine how the ubiquity of information
			technology will affect our children, and so on.
		</p>
		<h3> 
			Behind the Scenes
		</h3>
		<p>
			As far as technical acumen goes, I think Third Parent is my best demonstration of
			post-production skill yet. The A-roll of interviews is deliberately sparse; the B-roll
			is a mix of pixel art I've drawn frame-by-frame and animated in Motion, old photographs,
			public domain historical footage from archive.org, rotoscoping, and captured video game
			footage, all blended together for the duration of the 16-minute movie.
			<i>Third Parent</i> relies heavily on drawing narrative from pure post-production,
			conveniently fitting the theme of the growing ubiquity of digitization.
