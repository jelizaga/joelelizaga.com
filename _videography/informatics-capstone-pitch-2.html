			TellToo
		</h2>
		<p>
			Precisely one quarter after producing our 
			<a href="/vid/informatics-capstone-pitch-1.html">
			first capstone pitch video,
			</a> our project had undergone at least four name changes and an aggressive UI
			development campaign; now, we were presenting <i>TellToo.</i> Despite the aesthetic 
			changes to our branding and the name flipping, the concept remained the same: TellToo is
			a mobile-based storytelling social network based on temporarily accessible voice notes
			combined with pictures of the user's selection. You can read more about the project
			<a href="http://localhost:4000/mobile/telltoo.html">here.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This video continues the story-about-a-storytelling-app concept of the previous pitch. 
			Each team member came up with stories tangential to one another's to plug into the app
			during the video, essentially demonstrating a use-case for the application.
