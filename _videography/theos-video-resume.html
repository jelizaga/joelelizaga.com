		<h2>
			The Resume of the Future
		</h2>
		<p>
			My friend Theo, co-director during 
			<a href="/vid/the-battle-of-marathon.html">
				<i>
					The Battle of Marathon,
				</i>
			</a>
			was on the job hunt 
			and three quarters from graduation, but he had a distinct disadvantage compared to his
			peers due to a wide gap in employment history, as he had spent years training as an
			Olympic Taekwondo athlete in South Korea. He formulated a strategy; he would
			distinguish himself with a video resume. He approached me to produce the video. I
			performed my research, 
			<a href="/file/theos-video-resume/video-resume-analyses.pdf">
			analyzing sample video resumes he sourced for me,
			</a>
			and I determined the optimal approach; we would have him constantly in motion throughout
			the video in order to highlight the momentum of his energy with a soundtrack to match,
			and go the University of Washington's IMA gym to showcase his Taekwondo ability, which,
			consequently, is a display of his dedication to work&mdash;an asset at any company. Theo
			wrote the script; I shot the video.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think that this was a genius plan, because what makes Theo a marketable worker is a
			kind of innate enthusiasm and self-discipline that doesn't translate via the text of a
			90g single-sheet resume. I've observed that video resumes are especially appropriate
			in cases such as this&mdash;for example, if you're an artist any kind, or even a programmer
			or craftsman or the producer of any kind of tangible work, your labors cannot be
			demonstrated in a way that does them justice via static pictures and text. A salesperson
			can display their ability to persuade during an interview, but waiting for an interview
			puts you at the disadvantage of the person whose ability was already shown via video
			resume. During an interview you may make mistakes; with a video resume, you get as many
			takes to perfect your image as your SD cards allow.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm proud to say that Theo used this video to get an internship at KOMO News the very
			same quarter!
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, hit your boy Joel up if you'd like help with a video resume. I need to grow my
			portfolio.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Behind the Scenes
		</h3>
		<p>
			See the chromed bar on Theo's tie? That's not a tie clip. That's a clip to a lavalier
			microphone disguised as a tie clip. This was shot when my audio arsenal consisted of
			a lone lavalier with an obnoxiously mirrored clip instead of a more covert matte black.
