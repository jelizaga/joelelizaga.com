			Generation One
		</h2>
		<p>
			This clip primarily focuses on the half of my team that worked with the children of
			the <a href="https://generationone.net/">Generation One Academy</a> in Houston, TX. Generation One is an after-school and
			preschool program for the underserved children of the Third Ward. They operate
			numerous other community service programs unrelated to the care of local children,
			such as free landscaping and home maintenance for the seniors and the elderly of the
			Third Ward, which is the half of the operation I worked with.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the second of the videos I produced for AmeriCorps NCCC as my team's media
			representative.
