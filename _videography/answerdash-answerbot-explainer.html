		<h2>
			Introducing AnswerBot!
		</h2>
		<p>
			AnswerBot is AnswerDash's Facebook Messenger chatbot, powered by AnswerDash's predictive
			Q&amp;A engine to provide companies with a link between their knowledge base and
			customers, and reduce support tickets (and the need for support agents to attend to these
			reduced tickets) by automating self-service support via the nearly ubiquitous messaging
			platform. AnswerBot is especially innovative in that, despite being a chatbot, its
			interface is entirely point-and-click, though users have the option to type to the bot
			as well, and receive precise Q&amp;A in return. Click
			<a href="https://www.answerdash.com/new-product-details/#chatbot">here</a>
			for more information about AnswerBot.

			This video was timed to accompany the release of AnswerBot sometime in September 2016, 
			and I was thrilled to see it posted at the <em>very top of AnswerDash's front page, and
			featured in a 
			<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meet-jacob-o-wobbrock-an-entrepreneur-focused-on_us_5847496ae4b099808c198e09">
				Huffington Post article
			</a> about one of AnswerDash's co-founders, Jake Wobbrock!</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			As in the case of 
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/videography/answerdash-persona.html">
				<em>For the Users,</em>
			</a>
			I performed the voiceover during earlier iterations, before the team hired professional
			vocal talent.
