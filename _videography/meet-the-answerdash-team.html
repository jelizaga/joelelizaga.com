		<h2>
			Meet the AnswerDash Team
		</h2>
		<p>
			This was my first assignment at AnswerDash; to create a promotional video about the
			workplace culture. I was given a list of employees deemed fitting to
			interview for such a video and I arranged interviews with each. Beyond that, the
			parameters and instructions I was given were open-ended.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think this was an especially fitting first-project, as it doubly functioned as an
			introduction to the company. By the time I had finished, I had interviewed
			the majority of the team, and I had a well-sourced insight as to what employees
			enjoyed about their work and why, their operations, the reasons why they chose their
			careers, the tradeoffs of working in a small SaaS company, the history of
			AnswerDash and its culture&mdash;I had performed a sort of unofficial ethnography and
			thoroughly familiarized myself with AnswerDash.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Behind the Scenes
		</h3>
		<p>
			I performed every interview, writing different questions per employee based on their
			jobs, dynamically adjusted with suggestions sourced from previous interviewees. For
			example, "Hey, I'm interviewing so-and-so next; what do you think I should ask them?"
			and, "Are there any questions you would like answered, if you were a prospective
			employee watching a video about a company's culture?" I estimate that the average
			interview was about twenty minutes or so.
		</p>
		<p>
			The post-production stage of my work at AnswerDash was a kind of hybrid of Agile
			software development&mdash;an approach suggested by the VP of Sales &amp; Marketing,
			Don Davidge. That is to say, I quickly cycled through multitudes of drafts, iterating on
			the product as per the input of various members of the Sales &amp; Marketing
			department before the final product was shipped and uploaded to the company site. In
			order to accomodate this strategy I improvised a primitive version control system
			(I imagine modern NLEs like Avid Media Composer and professional production houses
			have more formal, industry-standard systems) of directories accessible to AnswerDash
			with various drafts, assets, and instructions for acquiring royalty-free music
			licensing.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may have noticed that I use the same music in <i>Meet the AnswerDash Team</i> as
			in 
			<a href="/vid/theos-video-resume.html"><i>Theo's Video Resume.</i></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			I had an alternative royalty-free track, but it turned out to be too mellow to fit the
			energetic image we were aiming for, and admittedly, at the time I couldn't afford to
			purchase a third track. AnswerDash always re-couped my production costs, but uh...
			the budgetary floor necessary between that moment and post-production just wasn't there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Royalty-free music is expensive, especially if you're avoiding synthesized instruments.
			Have you noticed that most videos on the web nowadays have the soundtracks of
			airplane safety videos? Thanks, RIAA!
