		<h2>
			The McKenzie Trail System
		</h2>
		<p>
			For our first round of AmeriCorps NCCC, my team built miles of trail system in
			Pima County, Arizona, in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.sdmb.org/">Sonoran Desert Mountain Bicyclists</a>.
			While a significant amount of Tucson's economy relies on ecotourism and the city
			is an important hotbed of the mountain bicycling community, there are currently
			zero trailbuilders on the county's payroll. Essentially, the network of trails
			around Pima County are entirely maintained and built by volunteer crews, including
			the massive National Arizona Scenic Trail route, which is a connector trail into
			Utah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The trail my team predominately worked on, the <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/mckenzie-ranch/?activitytype=1&z=15.0&lat=32.02415&lon=-110.59485">Hohokam Trail</a>, is one of several
			in the McKenzie Trail System designed by the Sonoran Desert Mountain Bicyclists
			(SDMB). While most trails on the system are mountain bicycle racetracks, the
			Hohokam is a multi-use trail that would conceivably link two trails, forming
			an unbroken route from Mexico to Utah by way of the National Arizona Scenic Trail.
