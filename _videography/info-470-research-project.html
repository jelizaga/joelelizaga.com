		<h2>
			THALK
		</h2>
		<p>
			For our <i>INFO 470 - Research Methods</i> class, my group (self-dubbed "THALK," an
			acronym for our first names&mdash;so long as you flip 'Joel Elizaga' to the more 
			acronymically convenient 'Leo J Agazile') spent a quarter conducting a research project 
			and producing the obligatory research paper. At the very end of the class, we were
			to create a 5-minute maximum video overview of our research and how it was conducted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our group didn't want to create something sanitized; Adam Sebetich stitched together
			a narrative, I brought my gear to campus and THALK improvised on the spot over two
			days. We included deliberate continuity errors and nonsensical, self-deprecating jabs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I never appear on camera, but I have a two-second cameo as a voiceover at the very end.
			It's my personal policy to avoid the other end of a lens.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Trackball Mouse Experiment
		</h3>
		<p>
			Our research project was to take a device unfamiliar to many iSchool students
			(a trackball mouse courtesy of group member Kevin Ke), and see if psychologically
			conditioning them to perceive the device as either very difficult or incredibly easy to
			use would impact their performance on a simple point-and-click test we designed. You can
			read our study
			<a href="/file/info-470-research/expectations-in-unfamiliar-territory.pdf">
				here.
			</a> Our results were insignificant. I suspect that we could have better concealed
			the purposes of our study to the participants and come up with a more
			psychologically impactful and realistic script for the experiment.
