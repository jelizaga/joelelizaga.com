		<h2>
			Kite-Eater
		</h2>
		<p>
			This is an animated reimagination of the 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nian">
				Nian Shou myth:
			</a> According to legend, Nian was a supernatural beast who descended upon ancient China
			every New Years to raze villages and eat children. On the eve of one formative
			New Years, the villagers assembled to steel themselves for the inevitable onslaught and
			organize a defense. Come the next night, the village frightens away Nian with
			firecrackers and a cacophony of beaten pots and pans, these activities henceforth
			becoming Chinese New Years traditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In our reimagination, Nian is a serpentine killing-machine that winds
			through the misty karsts to devour anthropomorphized watercolor kites, and the kites
			blow Nian out of the sky with fireworks we animated from red sequins we bought from the
			Jo-Ann.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Behind the Scenes
		</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Chinese New Year Animation</em> is an exercise in appreciating the gruelling 
			monotony that animators endure on a minute-to-minute basis and a testament to how
			two highly motivated and severely sleep-deprived individuals may accomplish absurd 
			things with $10 watercolor kits and yarn and scotch tape from the local hobby store.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consider this: We were told to complete a short animation in 10 or 15 FPS. We
			experimented with recording at 24 FPS out of curiosity, and, realizing that the
			animation became <em>that much more slick</em> with the bumped frame rate, we decided
			to shoot in 24 instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Okay. That's 24 frames per second: That's <em class="mono">24</em> camera clicks,
			<em class="mono">[24 * PUPPETS_ON_SCREEN]</em> movements of articulated puppets, and 
			<em class="mono">[24 * TURNS]</em> of the animation table's gears in
			the event that the backdrop is moving&mdash;per <em>second</em> worth of video.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the incredibly optimistic assumption that each frame took about 15 seconds to
			arrange, that's 360 seconds of work per second of video, which means 360 minutes&mdash;six 
			hours&mdash;in the animation lab per <em>minute</em> of video, give or take. This is
			discounting the mistakes and retakes, of which there were quite a few, or the hours
			we spent painting the set and designing the puppets. Total, that's 15 hours in the lab
			for this three minute video you see above. A non-trivial chunk of the video was
			padded with patterns of frames that I repeated in post-production, but I'd say that
			15 hour estimate isn't far off the mark.
		</p>
		<p>
			We were working on this thing from 8 AM to 6 AM over a few days. That's,
			shoot in the lab till six in the morning, nap on the couch in Wade's apartment for
			two hours, and go back to the lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			The moral of the story is: Frame rate matters, and people probably went blind animating
			Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Have you seen 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas"><em>
				The Nightmare Before Christmas?
			</em></a> Imagine
			how anguishingly incremental the process of doing something as simple as swinging a
			single puppet's arm was; how many micro-movements and intricate nudges had to be
			performed to make sure the movement wasn't too fast, given the film's frame rate. Now,
			while you're moving the puppet's arm, you have to curl its fingers too, so it looks
			natural. I hope they had decent playback on the spot so they could tell whether the
			shot was seamless or not.
