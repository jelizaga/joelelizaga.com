    	<p>
    		<em>Hippo</em> was a joke I played on my experimental media class. We were given the
    		task of producing a short hand-drawn animation. "Short" meaning approximately 10
    		seconds.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The video I submitted was 30 minutes long.
    	</p>
    	<p>
			Essentially, the narrative of <em>Hippo</em> is never-ending; it can be looped for 
			perpetuity, and would still make sense. A single iteration of the loop is 1 minute
			and 37 seconds long, shot in 15 FPS, and yet only consists of about 70 individually
			drawn frames. How is that possible?

			Static holds&mdash;the lazy animator's best friend.

    		Behind the Scenes
    	</h3>

    	<p>
    		In the penultimate scene, I lifted the animation table's camera, exposing the
    		lab's production process. Essentially, a Canon Rebel (I forgot the exact model) is
    		mounted over a large wooden table that we can manipulate laterally using a series of
    		cranks. The Rebel is tethered to a single-button remote that shoots a single frame upon
    		activation and a cable connects the camera to a nearby workstation and dumps the image into
    		our animation software, <a href="http://www.dragonframe.com/">Dragonframe.</a> This was
    		the same setup used to animate 
    		<a href="/vid/chinese-new-year.html"><em>Chinese New Year.</em></a>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		As you can see in the image above, I numbered each of the animation's frames in the
  			top right corners&mdash;we're on 50 in this shot. You'll see the obscure Acme peg system
  			attaching the frame to the table. The hole-puncher for this thing was worth hundreds
  			of dollars&mdash;the antique could only punch five sheets at a time. It was probably as
  			old as the chrome-trimmed, light-leaking, cinderblock-sized 
  			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolex">Bolex</a> cameras we used for some of our
  			other projects that quarter.
