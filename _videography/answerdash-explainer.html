			Explaining AnswerDash
		</h2>
		<p>
			I was tasked with producing an AnswerDash explainer video in the style of my 
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/videography/answerdash-answerbot-explainer"><i>
				AnswerBot Explainer.
			</i></a> One might think that I would've completed the AnswerDash
			Explainer long before the AnswerBot one, as it happens to be the company's foremost
			established product, but there was already an explainer video in its place. Once the
			company rebranded and overhauled their web site, it became necessary for me to replace
			the previous video so as to aesthetically blend with the latest updates.
		</p>
		<p>
			The production process of <i>AnswerDash Explainer</i> mirrors the one I did on
			AnswerBot. As this video focuses on AnswerDash's primary product (its web-based
			Q&amp;A tab, engine, and administration interface) the stakes were higher, and the
			refinement process more lengthy; this is the video the sales department would refer
			clients to in order to efficiently communicate the benefits of the AnswerDash product.
