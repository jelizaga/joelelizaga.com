			Fictional Airlines Adopts Self-Service Support
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Sales &amp; Marketing team at AnswerDash positioned this video to be a campy,
			light-hearted user persona-targetted video that aims to extoll the benefits of
			AnswerDash from the user's perspective. In this case, our protagonist, Sam, is
			struggling to find his airline's charges for oversized bags; without the AnswerDash
			solution installed, Sam abandons his prospective vacation to the Hawaiian Islands 
			altogether.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if Fictional Airlines had implemented the AnswerDash Q&amp;A tab, Sam would 
			have been able to immediately find the answer to his question in the context of the
			pages he was browsing, without having to hunt down a FAQ or pull up a live chat
			with the airline's support channels.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Behind the Scenes
		</h3>
		<p>
			Here's some trivia:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				We chose a support representative previously featured in <i>Meet the Team</i> to act
				as Sam&mdash;Tyson Bundy.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fictional Airlines is an actual web site I threw together in a day loosely based on
				that of United Airlines, running the AnswerDash tab via AnswerDash's Chrome plug-in.
				The happy sun is based on the sun I featured in
				<a href="/vid/hippo.html"><i>Hippo.</i></a>
			</li>
			<li>
				The background of the video is a 6'5 tall sheet of paper chosen to match
				AnswerDash's blue-based branding and the more whimsical, approachable
				atmosphere of the persona-targetted series of videos, affixed to the wall with
				gaffer tape.
			</li>
			<li>
				I performed the narration on earlier copies of the video. Admittedly,
				my manner of speech is naturally too sedate to fit well with such a plucky tone.
			</li>
			<li>
				That glass mug. I call it the "Chalice of Tiki." You can get one from Archie
				McPhee for $18. It's really nice. Bomb-proof glass construction. Good for parties.
			</li>
			<li>
				The contents of the Chalice of Tiki was a blend of two kinds of VitaminWater we
				found in the fridge, because both of the bottles were half empty.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The lighting is as-studio-as-possible, given my resources at the time and the
			confines of the conference room we chose to film in; I arranged
			several LED panels around Tyson in an attempt to obliterate all shadows and depth
			cues, as is typical in the Kickstarter'y-IKEAesque-ukelele-clapping-whistling short
			videos of contemporary trendiness. There's a practical reason for this beyond
			trendiness, though; without such an arrangement, my earlier recordings appeared
			moody and noir-esque:
