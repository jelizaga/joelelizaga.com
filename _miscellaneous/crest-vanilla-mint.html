			Bumbertooth
		</h2>
		<p>
			For an <i>INFO 386 - Professionalism In Informatics</i> assignment, my team was to
			devise a promotional campaign for the late Crest Vanilla Mint given a budget of
			$500,000. The assignment was inspired by an episode of <i>The Apprentice.</i> This was 
			less of an exercise of budgeting, research, or any such sober details, but rather a 
			challenge to create, and most importantly, <i>pitch</i> an idea. It was a exhibition of 
			our presentation skills, essentially.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our plan was to rent a venue in Central Park to throw a wild festival headlined by
			affordable local comedians and musicians. We'd have the headliners chuck cartons of
			Vanilla Mint to the masses. Festival goers could post images of themselves posing with
			some Vanilla Mint to social media in order to enter a raffle to meet Felicity Jones
			(I forgot how we settled on Felicity Jones), and we would project these Vanilla Mint
			selfies to the Times Square billboard.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had a lot of fun making those slides. This project marked my return to using Adobe 
			Photoshop over GIMP, so the fidelity is a little more creative, as I was less burdened
			by GIMP's learning curve and the relatively greater amount of hotkeys and clicks I 
			needed to run through to produce the results I'd like in GIMP.

			Bumber?

			It's a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumbershoot">Bumbershoot,</a> a
			popular Seattle music festival.
