		<h2>
			A Three-Minute Presentation
		</h2>
		<p>
			The <i>INFO 386 - Professionalism In Informatics</i> assignment was to give a
			three-minute presentation on our "tech industry role model"&mdash;the key here being three
			minutes. I'm most acclimated to a ten minute presentation&mdash;ten minutes is typical in
			college. Cramming a good defense of anything into a brisk three minutes involves
			diluting the topic significantly&mdash;ideally into the most hard-hitting and sensational
			components, which is the reason behind the selection of my arguments. Our presentations
			were recorded, and we would later individually sit with the instructor and rewatch them,
			analyzing ourselves for weaknesses in our delivery and strengths to maximize on in later
			presentations.

		<h3>
			Linus Torvalds?
		</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> is the 
			originator and benevolent project despot of Linux, an operating system and kernel that 
			he began developing for fun in 1991 and which now operates on nearly all supercomputers
			and 96.5% of web servers. He even wrote the industry standard
			version control system, git, for the purpose of handling Linux's development by
			programmers dispersed across the globe. Despite this fact, he isn't deified or a
			household name of any sort,  and doesn't seek to be. I don't think Linux is the best
			operating system (the best operating system is whatever you're most proficient in), but
			I appreciate his commitment to creating the best free operating system he possibly can
			since age 21. Such dedication is impressive.
