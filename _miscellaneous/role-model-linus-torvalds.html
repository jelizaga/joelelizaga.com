		<h2>
			A Three-Minute Presentation
		</h2>
		<p>
			This <i>INFO 386 - Professionalism In Informatics</i> assignment was to give a
			three-minute presentation on our "tech industry role model"&mdash;the key here being <i>three</i>
			minutes. Cramming a good defense of anything into a brisk three minutes involves
			paring down the topic significantly&mdash;ideally into the most hard-hitting and sensational
			components, which is the reason behind my selection of arguments. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our presentations
			were recorded, and we would later individually sit with the instructor and rewatch them,
			analyzing ourselves for weaknesses in our delivery and strengths to maximize on in later
			presentations.

		<h3>
			Linus Torvalds?
		</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> is the 
			originator and benevolent project despot of Linux, a kernel that 
			he began developing for fun in 1991 and which now operates on nearly all supercomputers
			and 96.5% of web servers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			He even wrote the industry standard
			version control system, git, for the purpose of handling Linux's development by
			programmers dispersed across the globe. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite all that, Torvalds isn't deified or a
			household name of any sort,  and doesn't seek to be. I don't think Linux is the best
			operating system (the best operating system is whatever you're most proficient in), but
			I appreciate that he's been committed to creating the best open-source operating system he possibly can since age 21.
