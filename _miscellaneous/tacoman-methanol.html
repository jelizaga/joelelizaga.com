			A Would-Be Refinery
		</h2>
		<p>
			Around 2016, Northwest Innovation Works caught public controversey over their 
			proposition to construct what would have been the largest methanol refinery on the
			planet in the Port of Tacoma. This project would be accompanied by two other potential refineries
			lining the Pacific Northwestern coast. This project was especially divisive given the refinery's 
			impressive blast zone encompassing downtown Tacoma, location within the Mt. Rainier lava flow zone, projected thirst for public
			utilities, the hazardous pollutants produced by the refining
			process, and backing by the Chinese government and British Petroleum through a series of
			subsidiaries. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These refineries would turn liquid natural gas to methanol, which would 
			then be shipped to Dalian, China, where said methanol would be converted to 
			olefinsâ€”hydrocarbons used in the production of plastics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Funny enough, Northwest Innovation Works 
			<a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article72656907.html">cancelled 
			their pursuit of the refinery's construction</a> citing "regulatory issues" before the
			infographic was even finished.
