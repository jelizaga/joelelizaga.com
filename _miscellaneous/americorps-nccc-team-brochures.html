			Sun 6's Team Brochures
		</h2>
		<p>
			One of my tasks as my AmeriCorps NCCC team's media representative was to produce
			brochures prior to each round of service introducing our corps members to
			future sponsors. I took it as an opportunity to polish up on some Adobe Illustrator
			and try my hand at document design.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our team transformed with time. We lost corps members and gained corp members. I've
			uploaded a combination of my team's first and last brochures to document how we
			looked when we first joined the program on January 22, 2018, and how our team was
			composed around summer of 2018.
