		<h2>
			The Trackball Experiment
		</h2>
		<p>
			For our <i>INFO 470 - Research Methods</i> class, we devised a simple
			experiment to determine whether positive or negative reinforcement towards an unfamiliar
			device (in our case, a trackball; we filtered our participants into Informatics
			students who were unfamiliar with using a trackball) would effect one's performance on
			a test of precision using said device and their perception of their own ability to use
			said device.
		</p>
		<p>
			We found a very marginal (insignifcant) correlation between positive reinforcement and
			our participant's performance on our test, but our sample size was rather small (20
			participants) and selected by convenience, so I suspect that such a trend was a matter
			of chance.
		</p>
		<p>
			For further information on our methodology and conclusions, you can watch the 
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vid/info-470-research-project.html">video</a> I produced on
			this very topic.
