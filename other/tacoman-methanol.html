		<h2>
			A Would-Be Refinery
		</h2>
		<p>
			Around 2016, Northwest Innovation Works caught public controversey over their 
			proposition to construct what would have been the largest methanol refinery on the
			planet on the tideflats of the Port of Tacoma, accompanied by two other potential refineries
			lining the Pacific northwest coast. The project was especially divisive given its 
			impressive blast zone, location within the Mt. Rainier, projected thirst for public
			utilities despite the watershed already bordering on insufficiency for supporting the 
			city, proximity to the populace, the hazardous pollutants produced by the refining
			process, and backing by the Chinese government and British Petroleum through a series of
			subsidiaries. These refineries would turn liquid natural gas to methanol, which would 
			then be shipped to Dalian, China, where said methanol would be converted to 
			olefins—hydrocarbons used in the production of certain plastics.

			While I was creating this infographic, I was planning on following the story by filming
			an amateur documentary. Funny enough, Northwest Innovation Works 
			<a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article72656907.html">cancelled 
			their pursuit of the refinery's construction</a> citing "regulatory issues" before the
			infographic was even finished.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of writing this page, Northwest Innovation Works is in the process of achieving
			regulatory approval for a different methanol refinery of comparable scale in
			Kalama, Washington. You can read about this further on their
