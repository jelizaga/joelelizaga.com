<div class="content">

	<h2>
		Movement
	</h2>

	<h2>
		Entry Buttons
	</h2>

	<p>
		This is something that I'd been waiting to resolve for what felt like forever: On iOS
		devices, you can't scroll embedded .pdfs. You just can't do it. I'd pull up my site
		on my phone, and my .pdfs would be plastered there; you'd swipe, and they'd remain
		static. I can understand why: If a scrollable .pdf obstructs the user from scrolling 
		elsewhere on a page, the user is stuck.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had another problem: How can visitors intuit that they can enter the sites under the
		'Websites' section by clicking on the header images at the top of the respective
		articles?
	</p>
	<p>
		Bam. Make clearly labeled, clickable buttons directly linked to the .pdfs and websites.
		Two birds, one stone!
	</p>

	<h2>
		The Tiles
	</h2>
	<video src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/12-11-18/tiled-menu.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
	<p>
		This could be an unchecked sunk-cost affinity, but I'm proud of the tiles. I don't like it
		when color of an image is entirely obstructed by a semi-transluscent pop-up descriptive 
		text. It'd make no sense to run a carousel of screenshots if they're 50% darker by way of 
		"Here's what I did in this project, yatta yatta," so I lure users into scrolling over tiles 
		to read only semi-obstructive descriptions... and then I run the image carousels.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to the descriptions, it used to be that the user would have to unknowingly wait for 
		the carousel to run on mouseover. A visitor could feasibly browse the site and have no idea
		that the tiles had image carousels in the first place. By including pop-up descriptions, I
		incentivize users to experience the carousels by way of having them stop to read the
		descriptions in the first place, giving the image carousels enough time to be executed by
		their browsers.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Pseudo-Responsive Design
	</h2>
	<video src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/12-11-18/resizing.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
	<p>
		I decided to avoid a multi-columned, oft-gridded design, with the theory that there'll be
		this continuing trend of cramming higher pixel density into increasingly tinier devices.
		If people end up using touch to navigate the web, I figured that it'd be easier to always
		have big, selectable elements more conducive to their fingers than text hyperlinks or
		gridded tiles representing my projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		On a commercial site with a larger selection and variety of content, it'd make sense to
		bolt together a sophisticated bootstrap.css multi-column approach, but in this case, I've
		stuck everything into a single waterfall of content with the assumption that it'll
		minimize distraction by side elements and complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'll also have less work in the future fussing with the media query break points.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've yet to test the site on a 4K+ screen, and I'm a little anxious as to how the site
		would scale on higher resolution screens. Would it be legible at all? I don't have a 4K
		monitor on hand, so this isn't something I can resolve without flying blind at the moment.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the future I may experiment with breaking the larger resolutions into grids, but it's 
		not a feature with any urgency.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Fonts
	</h2>

	<p>
		I'm trying to communicate a kind of 'intersection of technology and design' narrative with
		the monospace. I think there's a lot of great monospace fonts that we don't get to see too 
		often on the web outside of 
	</p>

	<p>

	</p>

	<h2>
		Jekyll
	</h2>

	<p>
		I don't plan to do anything sophisticated enough
		to require an interesting back-end, user interaction, or monetization.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think it keeps me in 'shape,' too: If I want a certain aesthetic, I'll punch it into the 
		style sheet, and if I want the equivalent of a plug-in, I'll write it up myself, though,
		again, I can't imagine wanting anything complex. Most of the unique features of the site
		that require JavaScript are entirely aesthetic. That's another design decision that I think
		is kind of fun; if a user visits this site while running NoScript, it'll be entirely
		navigable and functional! Admittedly, that's a stretch-case, and if I'm really so concerned
		with accessibility, it'd probably be better to make this a more pleasant experience for the
		color blind or the deaf.
	</p>
	<p>
		In retrospect, it would've been great to get some practice with WordPress, Squarespace,
		Drupal and the like.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>"Hey, I've got your three years of Wordpress experience!"</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		There's also the tangential benefit that visitors can't inadvertently or deliberately 
		access any login to an administrative CMS interface when there isn't one. No PHP or Java
		vulnerabilities, no forms, no nothing. If anything were to happen to the site, git's got
		it across a couple computers.
	</p>
