		I graduated from the University of Washington in the summer of 2017. For the next year I wandered
		the abyssal professional no-mans-land between <i>'aspirant UX designer,'</i> 
		<i>'aspirant developer,'</i> <i>'aspirant multimedia producer,'</i> <i>'freelance web-dev 
		&amp; videographer,'</i> <i>'open source geek,'</i> and <i>'someone please 
		interview me so I can finally pin down a mature, singular career path.'</i> If employment were personal 
		finance, my portfolio was a diversified, tediously sluggish climb through the gig economy 
		before the knuckle-whitening bounces of reversion-to-mean came to resemble linear growth. 
		UX was a hot field with fewer positions in the Seattle metropolitan area than software 
		engineering, with competition further compounded by the influx of professionals from UX-adjacent
		careers&mdash;graphic designers, illustrators, artists, animators, front-end devs,
		psychologists, creatives, industrial designers, engineers, and the like.

		<p>
			This is what it's like to finally attend a UX conference as a full-time UX designer.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		So even months into my employment as a UX designer at Infosys, I had sustained some
		incredulity. <i>Am I really here? Am I really a UX designer?</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		It wasn't until my fellow UX folks at the company resolved to attend the annual <i>Puget Sound 
		World Usability Day</i> conference that it hit me: 
	</p>

	<p>
		Whoah.
	</p>

	<p>
		<big><i>I've made it.</i></big>
	</p>

	<p>
		On <i>this</i> return to UW campus, <i>I'm</i> one of the fully employed professionals
		crowding the Husky Union Building for a badge-only UX summit among students trying to
		get their foot in the door, and not the other way around!

		Conference Notes
	</h2>

	<p>
		Reading <i>The Shallows</i> and <i>The Glass Cage</i> by Nicholas Carr intensified my
		compulsive note-taking habit by convincing me that any information that we neglect to
		regularly use will eventually drop from implicit memory. With that in mind, I wanted to
		get my time's worth from <i>World Usability Day,</i> which meant archiving the event in
		a little booklet for future recall:
	</p>

	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/pswud-notes-1.jpg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/pswud-notes-1.jpg"></a>

	<p>
		The speakers deserve their due attention for braving audiences to share their
		expertise, so I thought it would be a cool tribute to try and do their talks
		justice by transcribing their basic messages and illustrating this with doodles.
	</p>

	<p>
		This might also be an interesting bauble for anyone in the future who might wonder what a 
		UX conference in 2019 looks like.

	<p>
		The booklet is made from basic laser printer paper. I figured that each presentation on the
		itinerary would fit about a half-page, so during the talks I committed some 
		information triage to try and prioritize keeping the general integrity of the speakers'
		lectures intact while limiting the overall content to the four sheets of paper I brought.

		<i>Human-Centered Design for a Robotic Future</i>
	</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">
		<b>by</b> Krys Blackwood, JPL/NASA
	</p>
	<div class="right-img">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/robot.jpg" alt="A giant robot.">
	</div>
	<p>
		This was a really content-rich talk, and Blackwood's experiences at the Jet Propulsion 
		Laboratory (JPL) and NASA made for some great UX war stories:
	</p>
	<h4>
		The Europa Lander: 
	</h4>
	<p>
		NASA recently sent a robot on a mission to take interesting pictures and collect 
		& analyze geological samples from the surface of Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter. 
		This robot was fully automated, as was necessary due to Europa's incredible distance 
		from Earth, and would send a total of 48 kB of data back to NASA. It was estimated to 
		take <i>90 hours</i> for this 48 kB to travel from the lone robot on Europa to the United
		States. This tiny chunk of data will only be received once the mission is complete in
		2028.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Europa lander's artificial intelligence was developed and trained on Earth. The
		natural consequence of lander missions similar to this is that NASA engineers experience a 
		degree of anxiety as to whether their robots are optimally performing their missions 
		(if at all) while off in space, independently functioning as lone scientists in conditions 
		inherently different from the ones they're trained in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Krys found that this anxiety could be alleviated by allowing engineers to get <i>really</i>
		creative during the machine-learning phase of the lander's development. Just to prime
		their ability to simulate the most bizarre and novel situations on the 
		alien wastes of Europa, the team trained the lander to identify and photograph 
		<i>tentacles,</i> among other sci-fi pop culture emergencies.
	</p>
	<h4>
		The Deep Space Network: Patching Automation-Induced Operator Atrophy
	</h4>
	<p>
		The automation of the Deep Space Network (DSN) caused operator performance
		atrophy evident whenever tasks had to be performed manually. JPL/NASA experimented
		with various solutions to this issue of operator deconditioning, and found
		that intermittently shutting off the network's automation kept operators 
		vigilant and skilled. This technique carried over to the airline industry, where 
		enforcing brief moments of cancelled airplane automation keeps pilots 'fit' and passengers 
		safe. The danger of automation-induced skill atrophy was one of the main focuses of 
		<i>The Glass Cage</i> by Nicholas Carr (the 'glass cage' itself refers to the 'glass 
		cockpit' of modern airplanes).
	</p>
	<h4>
		On Automation &amp; Employment
	</h4>
	<p>
		The lecture began with Krys insisting that automation wasn't the job-eating beast depicted
		in 1980's sci-fi films, as robots excel at tasks us organics struggle with, like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			repetitive tasks
		</li>
		<li>
			non-rewarding tasks
		</li>
		<li>
			quick responses
		</li>
		<li>
			precision
		</li>
		<li>
			not panicking
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		... while they generally fail at tasks that involve human aptitude, such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			adapting to unanticipated conditions
		</li>
		<li>
			emergencies
		</li>
		<li>
			understanding whether responses are socially or morally appropriate (citing Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)">'Tay' incident</a>)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Because of this, she believes that humans will always be needed; our automatons will
		depend on us to make up for their deficiencies and inform their values and missions.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the talk, when an audience member pressed her about her belief that automation won't decimate human labor, Krys admitted that automation has historically
		weeded out industries: "Automation will always destroy jobs, like refrigerators destroyed
		the ice industry." She remarked that it's our responsibility, though, as a village,
		to help those who lose their jobs adapt and find new work. Krys emphasized that
		the 'robotic future' is an inescapable and truly intriguing design problem
		for us to confront.

		<i>Usability in 20/20</i>
	</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">
		<b>by</b> Ken Becker, Boeing
	</p>
	<div class="right-img">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/hawaii-missile.jpg" alt="A missile flying over Hawaii.">
	</div>
	<p>
		This was a retrospective on the historical trajectory of UX design; the issues we've
		long since solved (and seem trivial in 20/20 hindsight) and the usability faux paux 
		still at-large to this day, like rotating menus, the antiquated information architecture 
		of Hawaii's emergency response system (resulting in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hawaii_false_missile_alert">2018 North Korean missile crisis</a>) and the indistinguishable design of 
		elevator door closing and opening buttons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ken advocated we design for the 'self-explanatory' rather than the 'intuitive.' This is
		because intuition is a personal thing informed by experience, exposure and culture&mdash;all
		of which are subjective. Interfaces that are self-explanatory in nature are more usable
		and easier for us to pick up. I like this lesson, though we still need to determine how to
		create effective, self-explanatory designs without overwhelming users with too much
		explanation.
	</p>
	<p>
		He also wants to bring back 'user-friendliness' into UX nomenclature. I think that's a good
		move. Dark patterns and persuasive design can be understood as user-hostile in some light, 
		and reintroducing the term 'user-friendly' into parlance could guide designers towards 
		solutions that are just that; friendly to our users.
	</p>

		<i>The Future of Design Teams</i>
	</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">
		<b>by</b> Joe Dyer, Projekt 202
	</p>
	<p>
		"The Millennials are taking over," and it's time we evaluate the strengths of
		this new workforce and examine what it means to have predominately Millennial design teams.
	</p>
	<div class="right-img">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/dog-tv.jpg" alt="A dog watching TV.">
	</div>
	<p>
		One of the key traits that Dyer discussed was my generation's willful mobility. <b>71%</b> of 
		Millennials would like to work overseas, and <b>50%</b> of us would like to work in a developing
		country. I think single-sentence statistics like this provoke an interesting line of
		deeper questioning. Cost-of-living might greatly factor into my generation's perception of 
		mobility, rather than just our affinity for adventure. Would we still want to work in a 
		developing nation for developing nation salaries? To what degree will remote work 
		'normalize' pay across national borders the design profession?
	</p>
	<p>
		Dyer concludes that the blended workforce is here: <b>73%</b> of teams will have at least one
		remote worker by 2020, and this statistic will only rise. Gallup has found that remote workers
		report higher engagement and job satisfaction. We'll see a greater rate of freelancers
		in the workplace. He mentions that these freelancers tend to struggle with 'teamwork'
		(the trait most desired by managers) according to managers, and that they report being 
		willing to compromise pay for freedom and flexibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		He anticipates that designers won't be <i>as</i> impacted by the encroach of AI and automation,
		due to our work's grounding in creativity and emotional intelligence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Industries with the greatest growth that designers might be employed in include eCommerce,
		designing for seniors (to handle the growing population of retiring Boomers), video
		games (the industry has recently surpassed films in terms of annual revenue), and pet care
		and entertainment. He also sees great growth in the use of products using sensors, prosthetics,
		bioscience and kinesthesiology.

		<i>Designing Experiences That Connect Communities</i>
	</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">
		<b>by</b> Vicki Haberman, Alaska Airlines
	</p>
	<div class="right-img">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/airplane.jpg" alt="An airplane flying above some fluffy clouds.">
	</div>
	<p>
		Haberman's talk revolved around the sentiment that we should take the responsibility of 
		de-escalating the current atmosphere of digitally-grown loneliness and 
		instant-gratification that our field has created; to 'do the right thing,' like Alaska
		Airlines. I agree. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that the efficacy of designs to maximize profitability, 
		though, oftentimes has a correlation with levels of social isolation and vulnerability
		that enhances the predictability (and thereby direction) of user behavior. As experience
		designers, we're the vanguards that can discourage such predatory designs, but not all
		of us have the privilege to do the right thing when the right thing is often the
		financially or expediently wrong thing. Can any of us be the person to stand up and
		deny that consumers want same-day shipping, perpetual amusement, and to know what their exes
		are up to?
	</p>
	<p>
		Haberman discussed the merger of Alaska and Virgin Airlines as the combination of two
		airlines that folks love. And that's undeniable--audience members during this segment's
		Q&A reported that they really <i>love</i> Alaska Airlines, and as a Pacific 
		Northwesterner, I have an innate affinity for the airline too. Alaska has this cool, 
		Spartan branding that seems to reflect our remote, frontiery, high-tech sensibilities. It's
		region-exclusive; it's the Cascadian airline. Alaska's really hard not to like.
	</p>
	<p>
		For all the tales of shuttling bottled milk and passengers to the far reaches of Alaska
		in its early days and in spite of its excellent service (relative to that of other
		airlines), Alaska is still an airline and still has to compete with the likes of United,
		and with that comes environmental and psychosocial consequences. Last year a Horizon Air
		(a subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group) ground service worker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Horizon_Air_Q400_incident">hijacked an empty Alaska
		Horizon airplane</a> from SeaTac airport, performed some spectacular aero-acrobatics and joy-rode
		the aircraft for 15 minutes, then crashed it into a nearby island, killing himself. 
		When F-15s scrambled to make contact with the man, he cited his minimum wage. "We'll
		chalk it up to that," he said. A 
		<a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/08/17/30824665/i-worked-with-richard-russell-at-horizon-air-and-i-understand-why-he-did-what-he-did">piece by one of the man's coworkers</a>
		in <i>The Stranger</i> alleged that the situation for Horizon workers on 'The Ramp' was dehumanizing,
		woefully underpaid, militarised, and accented with a naturally high turnover and 
		hostile cost-cutting mechanisms that appear inappropriate given that this event took place
		during the expensive purchase of Virgin Airlines by Alaska.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given the recency of that incident, I found it hard to internalize this image of
		Alaska as connecting communities. They do some cool things; Haberman talked about how 
		the airline arranges personal 'trial flights' for autistic folks and those with 
		flight anxiety. My knee-jerk instinct for booking a flight is still Alaska for any
		excursion that requires more than a backpack. This bundling of the company with 
		connotations of friendliness and goodwill, though, had me experiencing some cognitive
		dissonance. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The invitation to wield our design expertise to connect communities with our designs and 
		heal the damages of division is a great challenge and something to bring forward in our
		future work. It's also a perfect segue into the lecture that followed.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subtitled" id="game-theory">
		<i>Game Theory for Promoting Strategic Human Interactions to Create Designs that Matter</i>
	</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">
		<b>by</b> Jeffery Dernbach, T-Mobile
	</p>
	<div class="right-img">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/prisoners-dilemma.jpg" alt="A sketch depicting the prisoner's dilemma.">
	</div>
	<p>
		Dernbach uses game theory and a bunch of whimsical illustrations to carry the
		audience to the hilarious reality that selling an ethical design to stakeholders, when
		understood through a thorough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a> matrix diagramming all
		conceivable product stakeholders and collaborators, is <i>actually</i> a matter of 
		boosting our personal reputations as designers so people will take our design more 
		seriously.
	</p>
	<p>
		That isn't to say that other methods of persuasion aren't effective, but the fact is
		that they're relatively 'inefficient.' For example, logical appeals to each stakeholder 
		would have to be crafted so as to court every stakeholder's personal self-interests. These
		interests, though, might not be shared or may even mutually exclusive across different
		stakeholders (for example, ethical designs may inhibit product profitability), so the 
		overrall 'sum' of design-acquiscence resulting from playing to individual interests would
		be less than the sum of design-acquisence grown from predicating one's designs with a 
		stellar reputation that encourages stakeholder cooperation and confidence.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wish I could find a copy of Dernbach's prisoner's dilemma matrix to cite or re-sketch. I think
		this is a lesson that we implicitly know, but to see it logically laid out in such an
		entertaining format was a well-placed and light-hearted addition to the near-end of the conference.

		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/11-15-19/amazon-spy-device.jpg" alt="Amazon Alexa, with speech bubbles popping out.">
	</div>
	<p>
		Cutsinger shares the Amazon Alexa team's discovery that voice design patterns are fundamentally
		different than what visually-trained designers are used to, and different in surprising ways.
	</p>
	<p>
		Idioms and verbal skeumorphism result in phrases like "turn up the
		volume," which only makes sense in English, and even then, doesn't <i>really</i> make
		sense ('up' is only something that can be 'turned' in reference to a dial). Amazon is
		'evolving' Alexa to handle these complications and dialectic nuances by supplying the
		personal assistant with as much 'training data' as possible, and developing a wide gamut
		of text-to-speech voices for Alexa. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The primary challenge
		of Alexa skill creation is to design the skill to be extendable, while allowing users to access features in a way
		that closely mimics fluid conversation, rather than forcing users to navigate skills
		through menus, as in the cases of visual design and traditional answering-machine services. Given that voice design is a new practice,
		Cutsinger's seen designers experiment with different design methods to both maintain the human element of conversation while supporting the back-end 'logic' of the skills. Pixel-pushing isn't a concern in VUI design; the issue appears to be designing an efficiently traversible web of conversation that suspends the user's disbelief that they're talking with a semi-sentient machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cutsinger reports that Alexa has over 100,000 skills (the VUI-equivalent of 'apps') at the moment. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I wonder what would make a neat Alexa skill. I haven't had the opportunity to play around
		with one of those machines yet.
