		I graduated from the University of Washington in the summer of 2017. For the next year I wandered
		the abyssal professional no-mans-land between <i>'aspirant UX designer,'</i> 
		<i>'aspirant developer,'</i> <i>'aspirant multimedia producer,'</i> <i>'freelance web-dev 
		&amp; videographer,'</i> <i>'open source geek,'</i> and <i>'dear Bathala, someone please 
		interview me so I can finally pin down a single career.'</i> If employment were personal 
		finance, my  portfolio was a diversified, tediously sluggish climb through the gig economy 
		before the knuckle-whitening bounces of reversion-to-mean came to resemble linear growth. 
		UX was a hot field with fewer positions in the Seattle metropolitan area than software 
		engineering, competition further compounded by the influx of professionals from UX-adjacent
		careers&mdash;graphic designers, illustrators, artists, animators, front-end devs,
		psychologists, creatives, industrial designers, engineers, and the like.

		So when my team of UX folks at Infosys resolved to attend the annual <i>Puget Sound World Usability Day</i> conference and I picked up my badge from the student volunteers at my alma mater, that was when it hit me: 
	</p>

	<p>
		<big><b>Whoah.</b></big>
	</p>
	<p>
		<big><b><i>I've made it.</i></b></big>
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2016, I would've been one of the volunteers handing out badges for the discounted
		conference attendance. I had a portfolio of class projects and a sense of imposter syndrome
