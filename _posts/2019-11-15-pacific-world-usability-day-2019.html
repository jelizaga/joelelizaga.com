		I graduated from the University of Washington in the summer of 2017. For the next year I wandered
		the abyssal professional no-mans-land between <i>'aspirant UX designer,'</i> 
		<i>'aspirant developer,'</i> <i>'aspirant multimedia producer,'</i> <i>'freelance web-dev 
		&amp; videographer,'</i> <i>'open source geek,'</i> and <i>'dear Bathala, someone please 
		interview me so I can finally pin down a single career.'</i> If employment were personal 
		finance, my portfolio was a diversified, tediously sluggish climb through the gig economy 
		before the knuckle-whitening bounces of reversion-to-mean came to resemble linear growth. 
		UX was a hot field with fewer positions in the Seattle metropolitan area than software 
		engineering, with competition further compounded by the influx of professionals from UX-adjacent
		careers&mdash;graphic designers, illustrators, artists, animators, front-end devs,
		psychologists, creatives, industrial designers, engineers, and the like.

		So even months into my employment as a UX designer at Infosys, I had sustained some momentum
		of incredulity. <i>Am I really here? Am I really a UX designer?</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		It wasn't until my team of UX folks at the company resolved to attend the annual <i>Puget Sound 
		World Usability Day</i> conference that it hit me:
