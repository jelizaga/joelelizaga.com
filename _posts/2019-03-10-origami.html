		Some of my family were over for a funeral late last month, and I kept my baby cousin off
		his dad's back for the duration of their visit (he had work, paperwork to settle, etc).
		Third graders have an obscene amount of energy, but it was a relief to get away from the job search and
		just spend all day running around with nerf guns.
	</p>
	<p>
		The little guy got the idea to put together some origami as a birthday gift to my mom. Apparently the
		dependency for origami is square paper. Perfectly square. I cut some out
		of my notebook's grid paper with the best scissormanship I could summon. For this piece my cousin
		needed thirteen squares, each of which I made out to be <span class="mono">65mm * 65mm</span>.
		Under his direction, I helped out folding the 13 modular pieces, making inadvertent errors on every single one (which he patiently corrected), and the artist himself put together this... I don't have the immediate vocabulary for it.

		He didn't even need a <i>book</i> or a YouTube tutorial! <i>How is this??</i> My cousin set out to work with remarkable efficiency, visualizing the interlinking of these papers as if it were completely trivial, without any pause for doubt. No references, no nothing; it was as if he'd been making these since he
		discovered his opposable thumbs.

		I remember when they'd make us do the occasional paper crane in elementary school.
		The teacher would put up a diagram on the yellowing, dusty class overhead and we'd all be squinting
		at the projector screen trying to mimic the sophisticated little folds, step by step. I
		was always amused by the fact that, no matter what, no matter how many times I tried to
		get one of the harder origami pieces right, I could never make anything resembling the
		model we were supposed to fold.

	<h2>
		Information Ethics &amp; Origami
	</h2>
	<p>
		Bringing this back round to professional design work, there's apparent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami#Ethics_and_copyright">controversy</a> with regards
		to intellectual property and origami. As the art is easily reducible to diagrammed instructions,
		it's difficult to determine who has the 'right' to a work. Was it the originator of the instructions
		or the folder? How can we reconcile copyright with the fact that the originators of aged, well-known
		designs are unknown and un-attributable?
	</p>
	<p>
		And apparently, there can be <i>piracy</i> of origami instructions!
	</p>
	<p>
		Are you seeing the parallel here? Origami's a lot like software. Easier to reduce to and backwards
		engineer into instructions than, say, a painting, even in binary form.
