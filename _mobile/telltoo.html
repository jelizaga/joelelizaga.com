description: My team's informatics capstone project. "The storytelling social network" is an anonymous, audio-based network of conversations based on the concept of 'tangents' and conversational asides. By beginning with a single audio recording, we can feasibly create a massive, traversible tree of conversation and stories.

		<h2>
			The Storytelling Social Network
		</h2>
		<p>
			<i>
				"TellToo focuses on the journey we take as individuals to find meaning, purpose, and
				fulfillment in life. For many of us, technology has changed the way we socialize.
				Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have pushed social interactions to
				shorter, less personal, and more trivial exchanges. This has left certain core
				elements of socialization in the dust. Our project focuses on modernizing those
				elements and building a platform that delivers a more human centric method of
				sharing and connecting. Our mobile application allows users to tell stories through
				audio recording and visually navigate chains of naturally related stories."
			</i> - Christopher Li, Project Manager &amp; Originator
		</p>
		<p>
			TellToo is a mobile-based social media platform focused around community-building via
			oral storytelling. Our team (self dubbed "Who Said You Can't Bill Gates"&mdash;no, not, "Who
			Said You Can't, Bill Gates?" but, "Who Said You Can't Bill Gates," as if "Bill Gates"
			was a verb) unanimously recognized a sense of dissatisfaction and alienation inherent in
			contemporary social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, et al. In
			particular, these platform's proclivities to commodify their users, overwhelm them
			with advertisements, make them unwitting participants in psychological experiments such
			as Facebook's controversial research on emotional contagion,<a id="fn1" href="#source1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> and cultivate an atmospjere of 
			superficiality empirically demonstrated to psychologically harm their 
			users<a id="fn2" href="#source2"><small><sup>2</sup> <a id="fn3" href="#source3"><sup>3</sup></small></a> is antithetical to how a "social network"
			<i>should</i> function. With this in mind, we sought to design a platform that 
			specializes in facillitating genuine, healthful human interaction as our capstone 
			project.
		</p>
		<p>
			The theory behind TellToo's design and how we've set it to  has much finer mechanics 
			beyond this (the volume of documentation we produced is absurd), but I've reduced it to
			three primary concepts:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Audio</i> - TellToo users share audio stories, recorded via voice. We chose
				voice as the medium for our application, as we determined that video is complicated
				by matters of anxiety, self-consciousness, and the barrier of skill required to
				produce quality content, and text lacks the intimacy and authenticity of audio. Text
				fails to convey tone, inflection, and affect unless used with skill, whereas the
				communicates all of these with no effort on part of the user. Not only that, but
				<i>experiencing</i> audio is effortless. Video and text require your attention. You
				can listen to a story at the gym or in your car, your eyes totally unobstructed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Tangentiality</i> - TellToo seeks to mimic "fire-side storytelling;" a universal
				experience. No fire necessary: When you're speaking with your friends and you tell
				a story, quite often they'll feel compelled to share one of their own, tangential
				to yours. Soon, one of your other friends will chime in with their own anecdote.
				We facillitate the tangential nature of human conversation by allowing users to
				chain stories to one another, essentially helping to network a massive tree of
				traversable stories and conversations with time.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Anonymity</i> - While one might posit that requiring users to use their full
				name (and maybe even their face, or any other precise data) would encourage users
				to carry themselves with civility, we theorized that being personally identifiable 
				in a forum as public as social media impedes authenticity. Naturally, if your face
				is connected with your username, you'll be much more likely to project an idealized
				version of yourself&mdash;an image that even you might not believe in. With the 
				protection of anonymity, we hoped that our users would feel much safer sharing 
				stories.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We've yet to test these concepts in the wild. In fact, a running in-joke throughout
			capstone was this collective anxiety that our app would become "FartChainz" rather than
			"TellToo," because our users would turn out to be much more interested in responding
			to each other with 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOyEw9bT8yQ">
				fart noises made with their hands
			</a> than actual stories, and we'd end up with literal chains of farts. Hilarious as
			that is, I think it speaks to the incalculability of users' actions when
			they're allowed a system as huge as a social network.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The Prototype
		</h3>
		<p>
			One of the major tasks of the UX &amp; UI team was the continual construction of a
			behemoth, 152-screen clickable Invision prototype. This prototype served as a 
			high-fidelity idyllic mock-up of how the team would like TellToo to function and appear.
			The development team's task was to conform the actual application to mimic the prototype
			as closely (or, as feasibly given time constraints and manpower) as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			TellToo isn't available on the Google Play Store, and I suppose I <i>could</i> give you 
			the source code and have you run our product with the Android SDK by yourself, but why
			trouble you with that when I can just embed the prototype right here?
		</p>
		<p>
			Go ahead. Try it!
		</p>
		<iframe class="prototype" width="428" height="866" src="//invis.io/Z9BCHHU5K" 
			frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p class="mono">
			NOTE: Because InVision cannot process mobile phone gestures when used in-browser, if
			you click in certain areas designated as gesture hot-spots the prototype will behave
			as if you had performed said gestures. For example, clicking in an empty area may
			cause the prototype to behave as if you had swiped left or right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Try performing these tasks:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Sign up, sign in, or try signing in having lost your password.
			</li>
			<li>
				Check your notifications.
			</li>
			<li>
				Your account is new, so you're not following any tags. Add a tag to follow.
			</li>
			<li>
				Select a random story to listen to.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add that story to your collection.
			</li>
			<li>
				React to that story with an emoticon.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a story of your own!
			</li>
			<li>
				Purchase a collection of stories.
			</li>
			<li>
				Change your profile picture.
			</li>
			<li>
				Change the app theme.
			</li>
			<li>
				Go to the feed and search for a story using the search bar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Try to find the <i>secret level!</i> Hint: The secret level is a handful
				of extra material for the pitch videos and in-jokes we hid within the prototype 
				because Invision wanted $15/mo to put it in a separate prototype.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>
			The Design
		</h3>
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mobile/tt/moodboard.jpg" alt="Moodboard.">
		<p>
			To expand on my little explanation on the moodboard above: We wanted a color scheme that
			was  content-agnostic: We wanted the images our users chose to look nice no matter their
			own coloring, and didn't want to project too much of the application's brand on their
			creations. You can see a similar approach by sites such as YouTube and Instagram; white
			and black are the predominant colors, as these are user content-centric sites. To
			offset the sterile drabness of black &amp; white and make our application appear more
			friendly and approachable, interactive elements have bursts of bright technicolor
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the features of our application is that users can purchase color themes with
			story collections from the 'Community' tab, and whenever a user visits the profile or
			stories of another user, the content will be framed in the theme of that other user. The
			theory is that, if you like the theme another user has, you'll be more likely to ask
			them which theme it is, and where they got it, thus encouraging a trivial, but friendly
			interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			You might've noticed that I fashioned my own site off of concepts from TellToo and
			Airus OS.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you didn't, now you have.
		</p>

			Additional Documentation
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/final-project-documentation.pdf">
				The final, cumulative project document</a> - Includes assorted meta data,
				foundational concepts, analysis of our audience, audience research, constraint
				analysis, risk analysis, resource analysis, analysis of the competition, our
				project timeline, personas, user stories, a team agreement, wireframes, mockups, an early
				iteration of the prototype&mdash;59 pages. This was our final deliverable of
				Capstone I; in the subsequent quarter of this class, Capstone II, the project 
				evolved to distance itself from some of these concepts and this was reflected
				in our internal documentation, which I won't post here due to the undecided status
				of TellToo.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/usability-testing-prep.pdf">
				Usability testing preparation</a> &amp;
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/usability-testing-report.pdf">
				usability testing report</a> - Papers documenting our usability testing of an
				early prototype, the results of which influenced the UX/UI team to produce the final
				prototype you see above. Essentially, we boiled these results into a prioritized
				queue of features to add and resolve, then mowed through them to the prototype's
				finalization.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/momento-sketches.pdf">
					An early wireframe I made
				</a>- We initially envisioned our project as a web application; these are my
				sketches from around this period. Not only was this initially a web app, but we
				planned on hosting text stories, rather than voice recordings. As you can see, the product 
				hadn't even been named yet&mdash;in fact, we ran through some five or so different 
				names prior to settling on TellToo.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mobile/tt/early-feed.jpg">
					A legacy design of the feed
				</a> - This is a mockup of TellToo's (then 'MomentO') feed by Christopher Li. As you
				can see, we anticipated handling text at this time, and the complexity of the
				application was limited to a private &amp; public story entries, rather than the
				gradiations of publicity we implemented in the final product. The design language
				of this mockup is also substantially different from what we later established.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/privacy-policy.pdf">Privacy
				policy</a> &amp; <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/file/info-491-capstone/terms-of-service">
				terms of service</a> - Deliverables&mdash;I wrote both of them. It was an
				interesting exercise, balancing protecting ourselves from all undue liability while
				protecting users from themselves and reassuring them of the benign use of their
				personal data.

		<h3>
			Capstone Night
		</h3>
		<p>
			Every year, graduating students of the University of Washington's iSchool
			populate the entirety of two ballrooms in the HUB in an public exposition of our most
			ambitious projects. You can read more about the event 
			<a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2017/06/capstone-showcases-work-hundreds-ischool-students">
				here.
			</a> Our table included Chris' tablet playing a loop of four videos showcasing our
			application in action, the poster Sanchya and I made, two phones running TellToo
			for visitors to use, and a stack of molasses cookies to lure those visitors in.

			to the event's hashtag and it was projected on the large screen behind us.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The Icon?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Here's some trivia: The application icon of TellToo is an arrangement each of our team
			members' silhouettes that I designed for the sole purpose of garnishing our poster, but 
			while I was working on them I posted this faux-album cover on our Slack as a joke:
		</p>
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mobile/tt/scoliosis.jpg" alt="Streets of Scoliosis!">
		<p>
			<i>Streets of Scoliosis</i> looks like a early 00's English synthwave album, right?
			Maybe something that The Knife would do, except about informatics&mdash;and scoliosis. While
			we agreed that the application needed something more visually punchy as the icon, it
			was the most aesthetically brand-consistent and iconifiable image we had on hand, so we
			ran with it and decided to change it during post-capstone development.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The Future of TellToo
		</h3>
		<p>
			Development has stagnated since our team graduated into the post-grad job hunt, but I
			see great potential in the careful engineering of an intentionally humanist social 
			network. If you're looking for problems to solve, the domain of social media, though
			dominated by well-established juggernauts, is a ripe frontier; it's saturated with poor
			solutions. If you're interested in the TellToo project, I suggest you contact
			Christopher Li.
