She's conscious of social media's ability to waste her time and perpetuate toxic behavior (to the detriment of her mental health and career), so she wants to limit her exposure as much as possible. <em>How can we help Sam make new connections while respecting her time-consciousness and wariness of traditional social media?</em>
