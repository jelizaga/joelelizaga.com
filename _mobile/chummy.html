			Personas
		</h3>
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mobile/chummy/persona-1.jpg" alt="A UX persona; Sam.">
		<p class="caption">
			Sam is a savvy front-end developer who recently moved to a new city and wants to make some friends. She's conscious of social media's ability to waste her time and perpetuate toxic behavior (to the detriment of her mental health and career), so she wants to limit her exposure as much as possible. <em>How can we help Sam make new connections while respecting her time-consciousness and wariness towards traditional social media?</em>
		</p>
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mobile/chummy/persona-2.jpg" alt="A different UX persona; Jacob.">
		<p class="caption">
			Jacob's a writer who recently adopted a corgi named 'Milo.' Jacob realizes his need to connect with other dog owners in order to socialize Milo, but he's too timid to approach other dog owners in person. He doesn't have an affinity for technology, but he'd consider using an app if it makes meeting other dog owners a little easier. <em>How can we design our solution so Jacob can quickly connect with new folks and take his dog, Milo, on play-dates?</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Our personas were the product of research on the social media habits, convictions, and dispositions of immediately available subjects.
		</p>
		<p>
			That is to say, 'Sam' and 'Jacob' are loose representations of fellow Infosys designers, tech folks, our friends, and relatives. You'll notice that there's similarities between the two: both have white-collar jobs and live in cosmopolitan areas. This narrowed demographic allowed us to focus on the values of the hypothetical users we had access to, albiet at the cost of Chummy's broader appeal.
